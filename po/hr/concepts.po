"Unlike some other programs, GIMP does not give you the option of putting all "

"Earlier versions of GIMP (up to GIMP 1.2.5) were very profligate with "
"dialogs: advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at once, "
"scattered all over the screen and very difficult to keep track of. GIMP 2.0 "
"is much better in this respect, because it allows dialogs to be docked "
"together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot actually "
"contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels, Paths, and "
