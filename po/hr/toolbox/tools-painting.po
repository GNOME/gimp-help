"The Pencil is the crudest of the tools in this group: it makes hard, non-anti-"
"aliased brushstrokes. The Paintbrush is intermediate: it is probably the most "
"commonly used of the group. The Airbrush is the most flexible and "
"controllable: it is the only one for which the amount of paint applied "
"depends on the speed of brush movement. This flexibility also makes it a bit "
"more difficult to use than the Paintbrush, however."
