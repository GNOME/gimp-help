"<acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s implementation of Undo is rather sophisticated. "

"<emphasis>compressed</emphasis>, so that doing them several times in a row "
"produces only a single point in the Undo History. However, there are other "
"operations that may consume a lot of undo memory. Most filters are "
"implemented by plug-ins, so the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> core has no "
"efficient way of knowing what changed. As such, there is no way to implement "
"Undo except by memorizing the entire contents of the affected layer before "

"Brushes in this category can make more than one kind of mark on an image. "
"They are indicated by small red triangles at the lower right corner of the "
"brush symbol in the Brushes dialog. They are sometimes called \"animated "
"brushes\" because the marks change as you trace out a brushstroke. In "
"principle, image hose brushes can be very sophisticated, especially if you "
"use a tablet, changing shape as a function of pressure, angle, etc. These "
"possibilities have never really been exploited, however; and the ones "
"supplied with <acronym>GIMP</acronym> are relatively simple (but still quite "
