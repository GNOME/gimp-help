"The Scissors Select tool is an interesting piece of equipment: it has some "

"Scissors, you click to create a set of \"control nodes\", also referred to "
"as anchors or control points, at the edges of the region you are trying to "

"nodes, following any high-contrast edges it can find. If you are lucky, the "
