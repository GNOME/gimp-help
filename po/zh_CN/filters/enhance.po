"This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively over the image. "
"For each pixel the variance of the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, "
"and the amount of smoothing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea "
"is that if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the image, while "
"if the variance is large, it is because of <quote>wanted</quote> image "
"features. As usual the <parameter>Radius</parameter> parameter controls the "
"effective radius, but it probably advisable to leave the radius between 0.8 "
"and 1.0 for the variance calculation to be meaningful. The <parameter>Alpha</"
"parameter> parameter sets the noise threshold, over which less smoothing "
"will be done. This means that small values of <parameter>Alpha</parameter> "
"will give the most subtle filtering effect, while large values will tend to "
"smooth all parts of the image. You could start with values like "
"<parameter>Alpha</parameter> = 0.2, <parameter>Radius</parameter> = 1.0, and "
"try increasing or decreasing the <parameter>Alpha</parameter> parameter to "
"get the desired effect. This type of filter is best for filtering out "
"dithering noise in both bitmap and color images."

"1.0), a pass of the median filter (<parameter>Alpha</parameter> = 1.0, "
