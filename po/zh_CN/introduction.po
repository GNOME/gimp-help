"Faster loading of ABR brushes: GIMP now spends a lot less time loading "
"Photoshop’s brushes (ABR). So if you use a lot of those, the startup time "
"will become pleasantly smaller, by order of a magnitude. The technical "
"explanation is that GIMP used to read the stream of ABR data byte by byte, "
"and now it uses scanline reading instead."

"PSD support improvements: PSD support improvements PSD files now load faster "
"mostly by eliminating excessive copies between the original file and the "
"project representation inside GIMP. For large PSD files, the loading is now "
"~1.5 to ~2 times faster. Moreover, GIMP is now capable of loading CMYK(A) "
"PSD files (only 8-bit per channel for now). It does so by converting pixels "
"to RGB(A) float using sRGB as the profile which, we know, is not good enough "
"for serious work. However, the plug-in is already using BABL formats to "
"specify and communicate CMYK pixel format encodings with GIMP. This is a "
"good first step towards better CMYK support. It can be improved both on its "
"own as well as integrate with the ongoing work enabling general color-space "
"support for BABL formats in the development branch."
