"<acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s implementation of Undo is rather sophisticated. "
"Many operations require very little Undo memory (e.g., changing visibility "

"of the Undo History. Some operations, such as changing layer visibility, are "
"<emphasis>compressed</emphasis>, so that doing them several times in a row "
"produces only a single point in the Undo History. However, there are other "
"operations that may consume a lot of undo memory. Most filters are "
"implemented by plug-ins, so the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> core has no "
"efficient way of knowing what changed. As such, there is no way to implement "
"Undo except by memorizing the entire contents of the affected layer before "
"and after the operation. You might only be able to perform a few such "
"operations before they drop out of the Undo History."

"Digital images comprise of a grid of square elements of varying colors, "
