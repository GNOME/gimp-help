"The first time you run GIMP, it goes through a series of steps to set up "
"options and directories. This process creates a subdirectory of your home "
"directory called <filename class=\"directory\">.gimp-2.4</filename>. All of "
"the information about the choices you make here goes into that directory. If "
"you later remove that directory, or rename it as something like <filename "
"class=\"directory\">.gimp-2.4.bak</filename>, then the next time you start "
"GIMP, it will go through the whole setup sequence again, creating a new "
"<filename class=\"directory\">.gimp-2.4</filename> directory. You can exploit "
"this if you want to explore the effect of different choices without "
"destroying your existing installation, or if you have screwed things up so "
"badly that your existing installation needs to be nuked."

"Just a couple of suggestions before you start, though: First, when you run "
"GIMP, by default it shows a \"tip\" each time it starts up. These tips tell "
"you things that are very useful but not easy to learn by experimenting, so "
"they are worth paying attention to. If you find it too distracting to look at "
"them each time you start, you can disable them; but please go through them "
"when you have the chance: for your convenience, you can read them at any time "
"using the menu command <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tips</"
"guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Second, if at some point you are trying to do "
"something, and GIMP seems to have suddenly stopped functioning, the section "
"<link linkend=\"gimp-using-getting-unstuck\">Getting Unstuck</link> may help "
"you out. Happy Gimping!"
