"The Cartoon filter modifies the active layer or selection so that it looks "
"like a cartoon drawing. Its result is similar to a black felt pen drawing "
"subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas that are "

"This parameter controls the amount of black color added to the image. Small "
"values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and dark "
"lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the lines "
"thicker, darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines aliased. The "
"best, most natural results are usually achieved with an intermediate value."
