"This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively over the image. "
"For each pixel the variance of the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, "
"and the amount of smoothing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea "
"is that if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the image, while "
"if the variance is large, it is because of \"wanted\" image features. As "
"usual the <parameter>radius</parameter> parameter controls the effective "
"radius, but it probably advisable to leave the radius between 0.8 and 1.0 "
"for the variance calculation to be meaningful. The <parameter>alpha</"
"parameter> parameter sets the noise threshold, over which less smoothing "
"will be done. This means that small values of <parameter>alpha</parameter> "
"will give the most subtle filtering effect, while large values will tend to "
"smooth all parts of the image. You could start with values like "
"<code><parameter>alpha</parameter> = 1.2</code>, <code><parameter>radius</"
"parameter> = 1.0</code>, and try increasing or decreasing the "
"<parameter>alpha</parameter> parameter to get the desired effect. This type "
