"One of the greatest improvements of GIMP 2.0 over GIMP 1.2 is in the handling "
"of text. In GIMP 2.0 and 2.2, each text item goes in a separate Text layer, "
"and you can come back later to the layer and edit the text in it. You can "
"also move the text around in the image, or change the font, or the font size. "
"You can use any font available on your system. You can control justification, "
"indentation, and line spacing."

"Actually, you can operate on a text layer in the same ways as any other "

"without losing the results of your work."

"To understand some of the idiosyncrasies of text handling, it may help for "
"you to realize that a text layer contains more information than the pixel "
"data that you see: it also contains a representation of the text in a text-"
"editor format. You can see this in the text-editor window that pops up while "
"you are using the Text tool. Every time you alter the text, the image layer "
"is redrawn to reflect your changes."

"Now suppose you create a text layer, and then operate on it in some way that "
"does not involve the Text tool: rotate it, for example. Suppose you then come "
"back and try to edit it using the Text tool. As soon as you edit the text, "
"the Text tool will redraw the layer, wiping out the results of the operations "
"you performed in the meantime."

"Because this danger is not obvious, the Text tool tries to protect you from "
"it. If you operate on a text layer, and then later try to edit the text, a "
"message pops up, warning you that your alterations will be undone, and giving "
"you three options: (1) edit the text anyway; (2) cancel; (3) create a new "
"text layer with the same text as the existing layer, leaving the existing "
"layer unchanged."
