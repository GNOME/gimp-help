"A <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> is an image, usually small, used for filling "
"regions by <emphasis>tiling</emphasis>, that is, by placing copies of the "
"pattern side by side like ceramic tiles. A pattern is said to be "
"<emphasis>tileable</emphasis> if copies of it can be adjoined left-edge-to-"
"right-edge and top-edge-to-bottom-edge without creating obvious seams. Not "
"all useful patterns are tileable, but tileable patterns are nicest for many "
"purposes. (A <emphasis>texture</emphasis>, by the way, is the same thing as a "
"pattern.)"
