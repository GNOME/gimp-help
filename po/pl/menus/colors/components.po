"<guilabel>Preserve Luminosity</guilabel> option off, the resulting picture "
"would be at 75%+75%+0% =150%, very bright indeed. A pixel with a value of, "

"channel. With the Preserve Luminosity option on, the sliders will be scaled "
"so they always add up to 100%. In this example, that scale value is 1/(75%"
"+75%+0%) or 0.667. So the pixel values would be about 113. The Preserve "
"Luminosity option just assures that the scale values from the sliders always "
