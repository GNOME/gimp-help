"Solid Noise is a great texture maker. Note that this noise is always gray, "
"even if you applied it to a very colorful image (it doesn't matter what the "
"original image looks like -- this filter completely overwrites any existing "
"background in the layer it is applied to). This is also a good tool to create "
"displacement maps for the <link linkend=\"plug-in-warp\">Warp</link> plug-in "
"or for the <link linkend=\"plug-in-bump-map\">Bump Map</link> plug-in. With "
"the \"turbulence\" setting active, the results look quite a bit like real "
