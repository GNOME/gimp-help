"Most of them are based on gradient calculation methods and give thick border "
"lines. Look at fig.1 which represents color intensity variations. On the left "
"is a slow color gradient which is not a border. On the right is a quick "
"variation which is an edge. Now, let us calculate the gradient, the variation "
"speed, of this edge, i.e the first derivative (fig.2). We have to decide that "
"a border is detected when gradient is more than a threshold value (the exact "
"border is at top of the curve, but this top varies according to borders). In "
"most cases, threshold is under top and border is thick."

"The Laplacian edge detection uses the second derivative (fig.3). The top of "
"the curve is now at zero and clearly identified. That's why Laplace filter "
"renders a thin border, only a pixel wide. But this derivative gives several "
"zeros corresponding to small ripples, resulting in false edges."

"Some blurring before applying edge filters is often necessary: it flattens "
"small ripples in signal and so prevents false edges."
