Temporarily means that, unlike a normal selection mask, it will be deleted from the channel list after its transformation to selection. The <link linkend=\"gimp-tools-selection\">selection tools</link> sometimes show their limits when they have to be used for doing complex drawing selection, as progressive. In this case, using the QuickMask is a good idea which can give very good results."
