The first and primary channels display the <guilabel>Red</guilabel>, <guilabel>Green</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Blue</guilabel> values of each pixel in your image. Next to the channel name is a thumbnail displaying a grayscale representation of each channel, where white is 100% and black is 0% of the primary color. Alternatively, if your image is not a colored but a Grayscale image, there is only one primary channel called <guilabel>Gray</guilabel>. For an Indexed image with a fixed number of known colors there is also only one primary channel called <guilabel>Indexed</guilabel>. Then there is a optional channel called <guilabel>Alpha</guilabel>. This channel displays transparency values of each pixel in your image (See <link linkend=\"glossary-alpha-channel\">Alpha Channel</link> in Glossary). In front of this channel is a thumbnail displaying a grayscale representation of the transparency where white is opaque and visible, and black is transparent and invisible. If you create your image without transparency then the Alpha channel is not present, but you can add it from the <link linkend=\"gimp-layer-dialog\">Layers dialog menu</link>. Also, if you have more than one layer in your image, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> automatically creates an Alpha channel."
