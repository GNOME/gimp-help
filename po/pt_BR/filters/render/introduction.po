msgid "Most <acronym>GIMP</acronym> filters work on a layer by transforming its content, but the filters in the <quote>Render</quote> group are a bit different. They create patterns from scratch, in most cases obliterating anything that was previously in the layer. Some create random or noisy patterns, others regular of fractal patterns, and one (Gfig) is a general-purpose (but rather limited) vector graphics tool."
