Note that this noise is always gray, even if you applied it to a very colorful image (it doesn't matter what the original image looks like -- this filter completely overwrites any existing background in the layer it is applied to). This is also a good tool to create displacement maps for the <link linkend=\"plug-in-warp\">Warp</link> plug-in or for the <link linkend=\"plug-in-bump-map\">Bump Map</link> plug-in. With the \"turbulence\" setting active, the results look quite a bit like real clouds."
