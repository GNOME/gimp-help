msgid "This is a set of filters that blur images, or parts of them, in various ways. If there is a selection, only the selected parts of an image will be blurred. There may, however, be some leakage of colors from the unblurred area into the blurred area. To help you pick the one you want, we will illustrate what each does when applied to the image shown at right. These are, of course, only examples: most of the filters have parameter settings that allow you to vary the magnitude or type of blurring."

msgid "If you only want to blur the image a little bit — to soften it, as it were — you might use the simple \"Blur\" filter. This filter runs automatically, without creating a dialog. The effect is subtle enough that you might not even notice it, but you can get a stronger effect by repeating it. In GIMP 2.0 the filter shows a dialog that allows you to set a \"repeat count\". If you want a strong blurring effect, this filter is too slow to be a good choice: use a Gaussian blur instead."

msgid "Selective blur"
msgstr ""

#: ./src/filters/blur/introduction.xml:82(para)
msgid "The Selective Blur filter allows you to set a threshold so that only pixels that are similar to each other are blurred together. It is often useful as a tool for reducing graininess in photos without blurring sharp edges. (In the example, note that the graininess of the background has been reduced.) The implementation is much slower than a Gaussian blur, though, so you should not use it unless you really need the selectivity."

(The <link linkend=\"plug-in-oilify\">Oilify</link> filter, in the Artistic Filters group, has a similar effect, but with irregular blobs instead of perfectly square pixels.)"
