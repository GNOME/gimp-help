msgid "Images captured by videocards, especially when fast movement is recorded, may look blurred and stripped, with split objects. This is due to how cameras work. They don't record 25 images per second, but 50, with half vertical resolution. There are two interlaced images in one frame. First line of first image is followed by first line of second image followed by second line of first image... etc. So, if there have been an important move between the two images, objects will appear split, shifted, stripped."
