msgid "This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively over the image. For each pixel the variance of the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, and the amount of smoothing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea is that if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the image, while if the variance is large, it is because of <quote>wanted</quote> image features. As usual the <parameter>Radius</parameter> parameter controls the effective radius, but it probably advisable to leave the radius between 0.8 and 1.0 for the variance calculation to be meaningful. The <parameter>Alpha</parameter> parameter sets the noise threshold, over which less smoothing will be done. This means that small values of <parameter>Alpha</parameter> will give the most subtle filtering effect, while large values will tend to smooth all parts of the image. You could start with values like <parameter>Alpha</parameter> = 0.2, <parameter>Radius</parameter> = 1.0, and try increasing or decreasing the <parameter>Alpha</parameter> parameter to get the desired effect. This type of filter is best for filtering out dithering noise in both bitmap and color images."

For instance to turn a monochrome dithered image into grayscale image you could try one or two passes of the smoothing filter, followed by a pass of the optimal estimation filter, then some subtle edge enhancement. Note that using edge enhancement is only likely to be useful after one of the non-linear filters (alpha trimmed mean or optimal estimation filter), as edge enhancement is the direct opposite of smoothing."

msgid "For reducing color quantization noise in images (i.e. turning .gif files back into 24 bit files) you could try a pass of the optimal estimation filter (<parameter>Alpha</parameter> = 0.2, <parameter>Radius</parameter> = 1.0), a pass of the median filter (<parameter>Alpha</parameter> = 1.0, <parameter>Radius</parameter> = 0.55), and possibly a pass of the edge enhancement filter. Several passes of the optimal estimation filter with declining <parameter>Alpha</parameter> values are more effective than a single pass with a large <parameter>Alpha</parameter> value. As usual, there is a trade-off between filtering effectiveness and losing detail. Experimentation is encouraged."
