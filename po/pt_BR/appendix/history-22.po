The GFig plug-in supports a number of vector graphics features such as gradient fills, Bezier curves and curve stroking. It is also the easiest way to create regular or irregular polygons in the <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. In the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.2, you can create GFig layers, and re-edit these layers in GFig afterwards.
