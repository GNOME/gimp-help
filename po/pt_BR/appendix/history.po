msgid "The <acronym>GIMP</acronym> arose from the ashes of a hideously crafted CS164 (compilers) class project. The setting: early morning. We were both weary from lack of sleep and the terrible strain of programming a compiler in LISP. The limits of our patience had long been exceeded, and yet still the dam held."

#: ./src/appendix/history.xml:38(para)
msgid "And then it happened. Common LISP messily dumped core when it could not allocate the 17 MB it needed to generate a parser for a simple grammar using <application>yacc</application>. An unbelieving moment passed, there was one shared look of disgust, and then our project was vapor. We had to write something... <emphasis>ANYTHING</emphasis> ... useful. Something in C. Something that did not rely on nested lists to represent a bitmap. Thus, the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> was born."

A program that would at the very least lessen the necessity of using commercial software under <quote>Windoze</quote> or on the <quote>Macintoy</quote>.

msgid "Version 0.54 was a beta release, but it was so stable that you could use it for daily work. However, one of the major drawbacks of 0.54 was that the toolkit (the slidebars, menus, dialog boxes, etc.) was built on Motif, a commercial toolkit. This was a big drawback for systems like <quote>Linux</quote>, because you had to buy Motif if you wanted to use the faster, dynamically linked <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. Many developers were also students running Linux, who could not afford to buy Motif."

Main programming advantages were the new toolkits, <acronym>GTK</acronym> (<acronym>GIMP</acronym> Toolkit) and <acronym>gdk</acronym> (<acronym>GIMP</acronym> Drawing Kit), which eliminated the reliance on Motif. For the graphic artist, 0.60 was full of new features like: basic layers; improved painting tools (sub-pixel sampling, brush spacing); a better airbrush; paint modes; etc."

msgid "In February 1997, 0.99 came on the scene. Together with other developers, S and P had made several changes to <acronym>GIMP</acronym> and added even more features. The main difference was the new API (Application Programming Interface) and the <quote>PDB</quote>, which made it possible to write scripts; Script-Fus (or macros) could now automate things that you would normally do by hand. <acronym>GTK/gdk</acronym> had also changed and was now called <acronym>GTK+</acronym>. In addition, 0.99 used a new form of tile-based memory handling that made it possible to load huge images into <acronym>GIMP</acronym> (loading a 100 MB image into <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is no problem). Version 0.99 also introduced a new native <acronym>GIMP</acronym> file format called XCF."
