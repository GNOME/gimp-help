msgid "The <guimenuitem>New View</guimenuitem> command creates a new image window for the current image, which you can set up differently from the existing display. You can create multiple views of any image, which are numbered .1, .2, etc., but only the zoom factor and other viewing options may be different. Any changes, other than viewing changes, which you make in one window also appear in the other displays which show the same image. The new views are not separate image files; they are simply different aspects of the same image. You might use multiple views, for example, if you were working on individual pixels at a high zoom factor. You could then see the effects your changes would have on the image at a normal size."
