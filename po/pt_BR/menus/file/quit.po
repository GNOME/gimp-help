If there are any open images which contain unsaved changes (that is, they are not marked as <quote>clean</quote>), <acronym>GIMP</acronym> notifies you and displays a list of the unsaved images. You can then choose which images you would like to save, or you can cancel the command. Note that if you have a large number of images open, or are using a large part of the RAM on your system, it may take a little while for everything to shut down."
