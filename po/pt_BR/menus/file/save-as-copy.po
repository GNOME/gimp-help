It always asks for a file name and saves the image into the XCF file format, but it does not change the name of the active image or mark it as <quote>clean</quote>. As a result, if you try to delete the image, or exit from <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you are informed that the image is <quote>dirty</quote> and given an opportunity to save it."
