It only works on layers of RGB images which have an alpha channel. If the image is Grayscale or Indexed, or if the layer does not have an alpha channel, the menu entry is insensitive and grayed out. If the <guilabel>Keep transparency</guilabel> option is checked in the Layers dialog, the command displays an error message."
