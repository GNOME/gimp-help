msgid "When you enlarge a layer, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> has to calculate new pixels from the existing ones. This procedure is called <quote>interpolation</quote>. Please note that no matter which interpolation algorithm is used, no new information is added to the image by interpolation. If there are places in the layer which have no details, you will not get any new ones by scaling it. It is much more likely that the layer will look somewhat blurred after scaling. Similarly, when you reduce a layer, the image loses some of its quality when pixels are removed."

msgid "If you enlarge a layer, the missing pixels are calculated by interpolation, but no new details are added. The more the layer is enlarged, and the more times it is enlarged, the more blurred it becomes. The exact result of the enlargement depends upon the interpolation method you choose. After scaling, you can improve the result by using the <link linkend=\"plug-in-sharpen\">Sharpen</link> filter, but it is much better for you to use a high resolution when scanning, taking digital photographs or producing digital images by other means. It is an inherent characteristic of raster images that they do not scale up well."
