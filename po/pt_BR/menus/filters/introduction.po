msgid "In <acronym>GIMP</acronym> terminology, a <emphasis>filter</emphasis> is a plug-in that modifies the appearance of an image, in most cases just the active layer of the image. Not all of the entries in this menu meet that definition, however; the word <quote>filter</quote> is often mis-used to mean any plug-in, regardless of what it does. Indeed, some of the entries in this menu do not modify images at all."

msgid "With the exception of the top three items of the <guimenu>Filters</guimenu> menu, all of the entries are provided by plug-ins. Each plug-in decides for itself where it would like its menu entry to be placed. Therefore, the appearance of this menu can be completely different for each user. In practice, though, the appearance does not vary very much, because most plug-ins come with <acronym>GIMP</acronym> when it is installed, and of course they are always in the same places in the menu."

But the <guimenu>Filters</guimenu> menu is the default place for a plug-in to place its menu entries."
