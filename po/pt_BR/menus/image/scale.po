msgid "You should keep in mind that an image can be located in one of four places: in the image file, in RAM after it has been loaded, on your screen when it is displayed, or on paper after it has been printed. Scaling the image changes the number of pixels (the amount of information) the image contains, so it directly affects the amount of memory the image needs (in RAM or in a file)."

#: ./src/menus/image/scale.xml:88(para)
msgid "However printing size also depends upon the resolution of the image, which essentially determines how many pixels there will be on each inch of paper. If you want to change the printing size without scaling the image and changing the number of pixels in it, you should use the <link linkend=\"gimp-image-print-size\">Print Size</link> dialog. The screen size depends not only on the number of pixels, but also on the screen resolution, the zoom factor and the setting of the <link linkend=\"gimp-view-dot-for-dot\">Dot for Dot</link> option."

msgid "If you enlarge an image beyond its original size, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> calculates the missing pixels by interpolation, but it does not add any new detail. The more you enlarge an image, the more blurred it becomes. The appearance of an enlarged image depends upon the interpolation method you choose. You may improve the appearance by using the <link linkend=\"plug-in-sharpen\">Sharpen</link> filter after you have scaled an image, but it is best to use high resolution when you scan, take digital photographs or produce digital images by other means. Raster images inherently do not scale up well."

If you do that, you should set the <guilabel>X resolution</guilabel> and <guilabel>Y resolution</guilabel> fields to appropriate values, because they are used to convert between physical units and image dimensions in pixels."
