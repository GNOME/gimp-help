msgid "If you have made drawing or editing changes to the image which you don't want to keep, the <guimenu>Undo</guimenu> command allows you to undo the last change and return the image to its previous state. Almost anything you do to an image can be undone in this way (with the exception of scripts, which deactivate this function). Further Undo operations may be performed, depending upon the number of Undo levels configured in the <link linkend=\"gimp-prefs-environment\">Environment</link> page of the Preferences Dialog. See the section on <link linkend=\"gimp-concepts-undo\">Undoing</link> for more information about <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s very sophisticated <quote>Undo</quote> functions."
