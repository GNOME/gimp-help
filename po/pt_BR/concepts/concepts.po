You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window (although in truth it is possible to have multiple windows all displaying the same image). It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image, though, or for an image to have no window displaying it."

Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of sheets, called <quote>layers</quote>. In addition to a stack of layers, a <acronym>GIMP</acronym> image may contain a selection mask, a set of channels, and a set of paths. In fact, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> provides a mechanism for attaching arbitrary pieces of data, called <quote>parasites</quote>, to an image."

Although large images may use many megabytes of memory, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> uses a sophisticated tile-based memory management system that allows <acronym>GIMP</acronym> to handle very large images gracefully. There are limits, however, and having more memory available may improve system performance."

You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. You can also move one sheet in relation to the others. Sophisticated <acronym>GIMP</acronym> users often deal with images containing many layers, even dozens of them. Layers need not be opaque, and they need not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers."

#: ./src/concepts/concepts.xml:102(para)
msgid "Digital images comprise of a grid of square elements of varying colors, called pixels. Each image has a pixel size, such as 900 pixels wide by 600 pixels high. But pixels don't have a set size in physical space. To set up an image for printing, we use a value called resolution, defined as the ratio between an image's size in pixels and its physical size (usually in inches) when it is printed on paper. Most file formats (but not all) can save this value, which is expressed as ppi &mdash; pixels per inch. When printing a file, the resolution value determines the size the image will have on paper, and as a result, the physical size of the pixels. The same 900x600 pixel image may be printed as a small 3x2\" card with barely noticeable pixels &mdash; or as a large poster with large, chunky pixels. Images imported from cameras and mobile devices tend to have a resolution value attached to the file. The value is usually 72 or 96ppi. It is important to realize that this value is arbitrary and was chosen for historic reasons. You can always change the resolution value inside <acronym>GIMP</acronym>&mdash; this has no effect on the actual image pixels. Furthermore, for uses such as displaying images on line, on mobile devices, television or video games &mdash; in short, any use that is not print &mdash; the resolution value is meaningless and is ignored, and instead the image is usually displayed so that each image pixel conforms to one screen pixel."

Actually this is a bit misleading: selection in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is graded, not all-or-nothing, and really the selection is represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel. The dashed line that you normally see is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected level.

In fact, you can usually undo a substantial number of the most recent things you did, if you decide that they were misguided. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> makes this possible by keeping a history of your actions. This history consumes memory, though, so undoability is not infinite. Some actions use very little undo memory, so that you can do dozens of them before the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other types of actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure the amount of memory <acronym>GIMP</acronym> allows for the undo history of each image, but in any situation, you should always be able to undo at least your 2-3 most recent actions.
