msgid "The Text tool is progressively improved. One of the greatest improvements of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.0 over <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 1.2 is in the handling of text. In <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.0 and 2.2, each text item goes in a separate Text layer, and you can come back later to the layer and edit the text in it. You can also move the text around in the image, or change the font, or the font size. You can use any font available on your system. You can control justification, indentation, and line spacing."

You can see this in the text-editor window that pops up while you are using the Text tool. Every time you alter the text, the image layer is redrawn to reflect your changes."
