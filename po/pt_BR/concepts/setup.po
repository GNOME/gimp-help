The configuration process creates a subdirectory in your home directory called <filename class=\"directory\">.gimp-2.8</filename>. All of the configuration information is stored in this directory. If you remove or rename the directory, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will repeat the initial configuration process, creating a new <filename class=\"directory\">.gimp-2.8</filename> directory. Use this capability to explore different configuration options without destroying your existing installation, or to recover if your configuration files are damaged."

The tips provide information that is considered useful, but not easy to learn by experimenting; so they are worth reading. Please read the tips when you have the time. Second, if at some point you are trying to do something, and <acronym>GIMP</acronym> seems to have suddenly stopped functioning, the section <link linkend=\"gimp-using-getting-unstuck\">Getting Unstuck</link> may help you out. Happy Gimping!"
