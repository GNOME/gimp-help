msgid "While opening a file, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> must determine the file type. Unfortunately, the file extension, such as <filename class=\"extension\">.jpg</filename>, is not reliable: file extensions vary from system to system; any file can be renamed to have any extension; and there are many reasons why a file name might lack an extension. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> first tries to recognize a file by examining its contents: most of the commonly used file formats have <quote>magic headers</quote> that permit them to be recognized. Only if the magic yields no result does <acronym>GIMP</acronym> resort to using the extension."

Perhaps the most important is the ability to create <quote>bookmarks</quote>, or <guilabel>Places</guilabel>, for folders that you use often. Your list of bookmarks appears on the left side of the dialog. The ones at the top, such as <quote>Desktop</quote>, are provided automatically. Use the the <guilabel>Add</guilabel> button to add the current directory to the list. Use the <guilabel>Remove</guilabel> button to remove the selected bookmark.
