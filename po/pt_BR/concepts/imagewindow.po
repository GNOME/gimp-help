You can also right-click on an image to display a pop-up image menu, <placeholder-1/>, or by left-clicking on the little <quote>arrow-head</quote> symbol in the upper left corner, called <emphasis>Menu Button</emphasis>, described just below.

If you make the window larger, for example, then you will see more of the image. If this button is pressed, however, the image resizes when the window resizes so that (mostly) the same portion of the image is displayed before and after the window is resized."
