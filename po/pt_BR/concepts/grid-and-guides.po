Often you can get better results by using the arrow keys on the keyboard (which move the affected object one pixel at a time, or 25 pixels if you hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key), but <acronym>GIMP</acronym> also provides you with two other aids to make positioning easier: grids and guides."

If you only want to change the grid appearance for the current image, you can do so by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Image</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure Grid</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the image menu: this brings up the <link linkend=\"gimp-configure-grid-dialog\">Configure Grid</link> dialog."

You can customize the snap distance threshold by setting \"Snap distance\" in the <link linkend=\"gimp-prefs-tool-options\">Tool Options</link> page of the Preferences dialog, but most people seem to be happy with the default value of 8 pixels.
