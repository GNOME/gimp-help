There are over a dozen other types of dialogs used by <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for various purposes, but users typically open them when they need them and close them when they are done. Knowledgeable users generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and Layers dialog open at all times. The Toolbox is essential to many <acronym>GIMP</acronym> operations. The Tool Options section is actually a separate dialog, shown docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost always have it set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to see how their options are set. The Layers dialog comes into play when you work with an image with multiple layers: after you advance beyond the most basic stages of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> expertise, this means <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>. And of course it helps to display the images you're editing on the screen; if you close the image window before saving your work, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will ask you whether you want to close the file."

You can then look through the rest of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things that are possible. Have fun!"
