You can hit the <guibutton>Refresh</guibutton> button, which reindexes the brush directory. GIMP uses three file formats for brushes:"

msgid "The <filename>.gbr</filename> (\"<emphasis>g</emphasis>imp <emphasis>br</emphasis>ush\") format is used for ordinary and color brushes. You can convert many other types of images, including many brushes used by other programs, into GIMP brushes by opening them in GIMP and saving them with file names ending in <filename>.gbr</filename>. This brings up a dialog box in which you can set the default Spacing for the brush. A more complete description of the GBR file format can be found in the file <filename>gbr.txt</filename> in the <filename class=\"directory\">devel-docs</filename> directory of the GIMP source distribution."

These brushes are constructed from images containing multiple layers: each layer may contain multiple brush-shapes, arranged in a grid. When you save an image as a <filename>.gih</filename> file, a dialog comes up that allows you to describe the format of the brush. Look at <link linkend=\"gimp-using-animated-brushes\">The GIH dialog box</link> for more information about the dialog. The GIH format is rather complicated: a complete description can be found in the file <filename>gih.txt</filename> in the <filename>devel-docs</filename> directory of the GIMP source distribution."

You can add new folders to the brush search path using the <link linkend=\"gimp-prefs-folders-data\">Brush Folders</link> page of the Preferences dialog.

msgid "There are a number of web sites with downloadable collections of GIMP brushes. Rather than supplying a list of links that will soon be out of date, the best advice is to do a search with your favorite search engine for <quote>GIMP brushes</quote>. There are also many collections of brushes for other programs with painting functionality. Some can be converted easily into GIMP brushes, some require special conversion utilities, and some cannot be converted at all. Most fancy procedural brush types fall into the last category. If you need to know, look around on the web, and if you don't find anything, look for an expert to ask."
