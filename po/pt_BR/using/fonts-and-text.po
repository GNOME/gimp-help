By converting a text item to a selection or a path, you can fill it, stroke the outlines, transform it, or generally apply the whole panoply of GIMP tools to get interesting effects. As a demonstration of some of the possibilities, try out the \"logo\" scripts at <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guisubmenu>Create</guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Logos</guisubmenu></menuchoice>. Each of these scripts allows you to enter some text, and then creates a new image showing a logo constructed out of that text. If you would like to modify one of these scripts, or construct a logo script of your own, the <link linkend=\"gimp-concepts-script-fu\">Using Script-Fu</link> and <link linkend=\"gimp-using-script-fu-tutorial\">Script-Fu Tutorial</link> sections should help you get started. Of course, you don't need Script-Fu to create these sorts of effects, only to automate them."
