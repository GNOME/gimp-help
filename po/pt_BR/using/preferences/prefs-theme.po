Clicking on a theme in the list causes it to be applied immediately, so it is easy to see the result and change your mind if you don't like it."

Custom themes should be places in the <filename>themes</filename> subdirectory of your personal GIMP directory: if they are, they will appear in the list here. Each theme is actually a directory containing ASCII files that you can edit. They are pretty complicated, and the meaning of the contents goes beyond the scope of this documentation, but you should feel free to experiment: in the worst case, if you mess things up completely, you can always revert back to one of the supplied themes."
