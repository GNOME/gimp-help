You will probably find, however, that the more you use it, the more frustrated you become with the difficulty of selecting exactly what you want, no more, no less. More experienced users find that the <link linkend=\"gimp-tool-path\">Path</link> and <link linkend=\"gimp-tool-by-color-select\">Color Select</link> tools are often more efficient, and use the Wand less. Still, it is useful for selecting an area within a contour, or touching up imperfect selections. It often works very well for selecting a solid-colored (or nearly solid-colored) background area."
