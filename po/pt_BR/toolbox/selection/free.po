msgid "The Free Selection tool, or Lasso, lets you create a selection by drawing it free-hand with the pointer, while holding down the left mouse button (or, for a stylus, pressing it against the tablet). When you release the mouse button, the selection is closed by connecting the current pointer location to the start location with a straight line. You can go outside the edge of the image display and come back in if you want to. The Lasso is often a good tool to use for <quote>roughing in</quote> a selection; it is not so good for precise definition. Experienced users find that it is often convenient to begin with the lasso tool, but then switch to <link linkend=\"gimp-qmask\">QuickMask</link> mode for detail work."

msgid "A new possibility came up with GIMP-2.6: the polygonal selection. Instead of click-and-dragging to draw a free hand selection, you can click only. This creates an anchor point. Then moving the mouse pointer draws a line with a new anchor point that you can move as long as you don't click again (the mouse pointer comes with the moving cross). Clicking again anchors this point and creates a segment. By pressing the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> keyboard key while moving the mouse pointer contrains moving angles to 15Â°."
