To render a filled ellipse, create an elliptical selection, and then fill it using the <link linkend=\"gimp-tool-bucket-fill\">Bucket Fill tool</link>. To create an elliptical outline, the simplest and most flexible approach is to create an elliptical selection and then <link linkend=\"gimp-selection-stroke\">stroke</link> it. However, the quality of anti-aliasing with this approach is rather crude. A higher quality outline can be obtained by creating two elliptical selections with different sizes, subtracting the inner one from the outer one; however this is not always easy to get right. The command <menuchoice><guimenu>Select</guimenu><guimenuitem>Border...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> makes it easy."
