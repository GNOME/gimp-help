"This filter lets you make diffraction or wave interference textures. You can "
"change the Frequency, Contours and Sharp Edges for each of the RGB channels. "
"You can also set Brightness, Scattering and Polarization of the texture. "
"There is no automatic preview, so you must press the preview button to "
"update. On a slow system, this may take a bit of time. Note that result "
"doesn't depend on the initial image."

"It seems clear that the plugin works by simulating the physics of light "
"striking a grating. Unfortunately, the original authors never got around to "
"writing down the theory behind it, or explaining what the parameters mean. "
"The best approach, then, is just to twiddle things and see what happens. "
"Fortunately, almost anything you do seems to produce interesting results."
