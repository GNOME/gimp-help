"Most of digitized images need correction of sharpness. This is due to "
"digitizing process that must chop a color continuum up in points with "
"slightly different colors: elements thinner than sampling frequency will be "
"averaged into an uniform color. So sharp borders are rendered a little "
"blurred. The same phenomenon appears when printing color dots on paper."

"The Sharpen filter accentuates edges but also any noise or blemish and it "
