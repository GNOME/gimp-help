"This filter does edge detection using the so-called <quote>Difference of "
"Gaussians</quote> algorithm, which works by performing two different "
"Gaussian blurs on the image, with a different blurring radius for each, and "
"subtracting them to yield the result. This algorithm is very widely used in "
"artificial vision (maybe in biological vision as well!), and is pretty fast "
"because there are very efficient methods for doing Gaussian blurs. The most "
"important parameters are the blurring radii for the two Gaussian blurs. It "
"is probably easiest to set them using the preview, but it may help to know "
"that increasing the smaller radius tends to give thicker-appearing edges, "
"and decreasing the larger radius tends to increase the <quote>threshold</"
"quote> for recognizing something as an edge. In most cases you will get "
"nicer results if Radius 2 is smaller than Radius 1, but nothing prevents you "
"from reversing them, and in situations where you have a light figure on the "
"dark background, reversing them may actually improve the result."
