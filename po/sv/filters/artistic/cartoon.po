"The Cartoon filter modifies the active layer or selection so that it looks "

"subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas that are "

"values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and "
"dark lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the "
"lines thicker, darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines "
"aliased. The best, most natural results are usually achieved with an "
"intermediate value."
