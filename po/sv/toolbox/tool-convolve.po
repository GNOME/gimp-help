"The Convolve tool uses the current brush to locally blur or sharpen your "

"out too much, and you would like to soften it. If you want to blur a whole "
"layer, or a large part of one, you will probably be better off using one of "
"the <link linkend=\"filters-blur\">Blur Filters</link>. The direction of a "

"sharpening filter, such as Unsharp Mask, on the copy. Then activate the "
"Clone tool, and in its Tool Options set Source to <quote>Image source</"
"quote> and Alignment to <quote>Registered</quote>. Set the Opacity to a "
"modest value, such as 10. Then Ctrl-click on the copy to make it the source "
