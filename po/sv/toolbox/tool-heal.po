"This tool was once described as <quote>The healing brush looks like a smart "

"relative to the Clone Tool, but it is more smart to remove small failures in "
"images. A typical usage is the removal of wrinkles in photographs. To do so, "
"pixels are not simply copied from source to destination, but the area around "
"the destination is taken into account before cloning is applied. The "
"algorithm used for this, is described in a scientific paper by Todor "
"Georgiev <xref linkend=\"bibliography-online-georgiev\"/>."
