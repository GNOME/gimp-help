"The Intelligent Scissors tool is an interesting piece of equipment: it has "
"some features in common with the Lasso, some features in common with the "
"Path tool, and some features all its own. It is useful when you are trying "
"to select a region defined by strong color-changes at the edges. To use the "
"Scissors, you click to create a set of \"control nodes\", also referred to "
"as anchors or control points, at the edges of the region you are trying to "
"select. The tool produces a continuous curve passing through these control "
"nodes, following any high-contrast edges it can find. If you are lucky, the "
"path that the tool finds will correspond to the contour you are trying to "
"select."

"Each time you left-click with the mouse, you create a new control point, "
"which is connected to the last control point by a curve that tries to follow "
"edges in the image. To finish, click on the first point (the cursor changes "
"to indicate when you are in the right spot). You can adjust the curve by "
"dragging the control nodes, or by clicking to create new control nodes. When "
"you are satisfied, click anywhere inside the curve to convert it into a "
"selection."

"Unfortunately, there seem to be some problems with the edge-following logic "
"for this tool, with the result that the selections it creates tend to be "
"pretty crude in a lot of cases. A good way to clean them up is to switch to "
"<link linkend=\"gimp-qmask\">QuickMask</link> mode, and use paint tools to "
"paint in the problematic parts. On the whole, most people find the Path tool "
"to be more useful than the Scissors, because, even though it does not have "
"the intelligent edge-finding capability, the paths it produces persist until "
"you delete them, and can be altered at any time."
