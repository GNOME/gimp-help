"Advanced users may be interested to know that brush tools actually operate "
"at a sub-pixel level, in order to avoid producing jagged-looking results. "
"One consequence of this is that even if you work with a hard-edged brush, "
"such as one of the Circle brushes, pixels on the edge of the brushstroke "
"will only be partially affected. If you need to have all-or-nothing effects "
"(which may be necessary for getting a good selection, or for cutting and "
"pasting, or for operating pixel-by-pixel at a high zoom level), use the "
"Pencil tool, which makes all brushes perfectly hard and disables sub-pixel "
"anti-aliasing."
