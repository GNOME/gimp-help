"The Free Selection tool, or Lasso, lets you create a selection by drawing it "
"free-hand with the pointer, while holding down the left mouse button (or, "
"for a stylus, pressing it against the tablet). When you release the mouse "
"button, the selection is closed by connecting the current pointer location "
"to the start location with a straight line. You can go outside the edge of "
"the image display and come back in if you want to. The Lasso is often a good "
"tool to use for <quote>roughing in</quote> a selection; it is not so good "
"for precise definition. Experienced users find that it is often convenient "
