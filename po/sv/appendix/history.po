"<acronym>gdk</acronym> (<acronym>GIMP</acronym> Drawing Kit), which "

"In February 1997, 0.99 came on the scene. Together with other developers, S "

"Interface) and the <quote>PDB</quote>, which made it possible to write "
"scripts; Script-Fus (or macros) could now automate things that you would "
"normally do by hand. <acronym>GTK/gdk</acronym> had also changed and was now "
"called <acronym>GTK+</acronym>. In addition, 0.99 used a new form of tile-"
"based memory handling that made it possible to load huge images into "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> (loading a 100 MB image into <acronym>GIMP</acronym> "
"is no problem). Version 0.99 also introduced a new native <acronym>GIMP</"
