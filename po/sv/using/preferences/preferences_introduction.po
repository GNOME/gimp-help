"The preferences dialog can be accessed from the Toolbox menu, as "
"<menuchoice><guimenu><accel>F</accel>ile</guimenu><guimenuitem><accel>P</"
"accel>references</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. It lets you customize many "
"aspects of the way GIMP works. The following sections detail the settings "
"that you can customize, and what they affect. This information applies "
"specifically to GIMP 2.2, but the settings for GIMP 2.0 are similar enough "
"that you should be able to understand them based on the explanations here."

"All of the Preferences information is stored in a file called "
"<filename>gimprc</filename> in your personal GIMP directory, so if you are a "
"<quote>power user</quote> who would rather work with a text editor than a "
"graphical interface, you can alter preferences by editing that file. If you "
"do, and you are on a Linux system, then <command>man gimprc</command> will "
"give you a lot of technical information about the contents of the file and "
"what they are used for."
