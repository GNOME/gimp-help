"GIMP uses several types of resources – such as brushes, patterns, gradients, "
"etc. – for which a basic set are supplied by GIMP when it is installed, and "
"others can be created or downloaded by the user. For each such resource "
"type, there is a Preference page that allows you to specify the "
"<emphasis>search path</emphasis>: the set of directories from which items of "
"the type in question are automatically loaded when GIMP starts. These pages "
