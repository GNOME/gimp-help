"This folder is used for temporary files: files created for temporary storage "

"This is the folder used as a \"memory bank\" when the total size of images "
"and data open in GIMP exceeds the available RAM. If you work with very large "
"images, or images with many layers, or have many images open at once, GIMP "
"can potentially require hundreds of megabytes of swap space, so available "
"disk space and performance are definitely things to think about for this "
"folder. By default, it is set to your personal GIMP directory, but if you "
"have another disk with more free space, or substantially better performance, "
"you may see a significant benefit from moving your swap folder there. The "
"directory must exist and be writable by you."
