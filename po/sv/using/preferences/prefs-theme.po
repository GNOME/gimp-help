"This page lets you select a theme, which determines many aspects of the "
"appearance of the GIMP user interface, including the set of icons used, their "
"sizes, fonts, spacing allowed in dialogs, etc. Two themes are supplied with "
"GIMP: <guilabel>Default</guilabel>, which is probably best for most people, "
"and <guilabel>Small</guilabel>, which may be preferable for those with small "
"or low-resolution monitors. Clicking on a theme in the list causes it to be "
"applied immediately, so it is easy to see the result and change your mind if "
"you don't like it."

"You can also use custom themes, either by downloading them from the net, or "
"by copying one of the supplied themes and modifying it. Custom themes should "
"be places in the <filename>themes</filename> subdirectory of your personal "
"GIMP directory: if they are, they will appear in the list here. Each theme is "
"actually a directory containing ASCII files that you can edit. They are "
"pretty complicated, and the meaning of the contents goes beyond the scope of "
"this documentation, but you should feel free to experiment: in the worst "
"case, if you mess things up completely, you can always revert back to one of "
"the supplied themes."

"You cannot edit the supplied themes unless you have administrator "
"permissions, and even if you do, you shouldn't: if you want to customize a "
"theme, make a copy in your personal directory and work on it. If you make a "
"change and would like to see the result \"on the fly\", you can do so by "
"saving the edited theme file and then pressing <guilabel>Reload Current "
"Theme</guilabel>."
