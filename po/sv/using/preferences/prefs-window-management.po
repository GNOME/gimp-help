"This page lets you customize the way windows are handled in GIMP. You should "
"note that GIMP does not manipulate windows directly, instead it sends "
"requests to the window manager (i. e., to Windows if you are running in "
"Windows; to Metacity if you are running in a standard Gnome setup in Linux; "
"etc). Because there are many window managers, and not all of them are well "
"behaved, it cannot be guaranteed that the functions described here will "
"actually work as described. However, if you are using a modern, standards-"
"compliant window manager, they ought to."
