"By default, GIMP shows miniature previews of the contents of layers and "

"you would prefer to disable these, you can do it by unchecking <quote>Enable "

"GIMP can give you the ability to create keyboard shortcuts (key combinations "
"that activate a menu entry) dynamically, by pressing the keys while the "
"pointer hovers over the desired menu entry. However, this capability is "
"disabled by default, because it might lead novice users to accidentally "
"overwrite the standard keyboard shortcuts. If you want to enable it, check "

"If you change shortcuts, you will probably want your changes to continue to "

"you can save the current settings at any time using the <quote>Save Keyboard "
"Shortcuts Now</quote> button, and they will be applied to future sessions. If "
"you decide that you have made some bad decisions concerning shortcuts, you "
"can reset them to their original state by pressing <quote>Reset Saved "
