"There are many things you can do to vary the appearance of text beyond just "
"rendering it with different fonts or different colors. By converting a text "
"item to a selection or a path, you can fill it, stroke the outlines, "
"transform it, or generally apply the whole panoply of GIMP tools to get "
"interesting effects. As a demonstration of some of the possibilities, try "
"out the \"logo\" scripts in the Toolbox menu, at <menuchoice><guimenu>Xtns</"
"guimenu><guisubmenu>Script-Fu</guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Logos</guisubmenu></"
"menuchoice>. Each of these scripts allows you to enter some text, and then "
"creates a new image showing a logo constructed out of that text. If you "
"would like to modify one of these scripts, or construct a logo script of "
"your own, the <link linkend=\"gimp-concepts-script-fu\">Using Script-Fu</"
"link> and <link linkend=\"gimp-using-script-fu-tutorial\">Script-Fu "
"Tutorial</link> sections should help you get started. Of course, you don't "

"Problems with fonts have probably been responsible for more GIMP 2 bug "

"you experience crashes at start-up when GIMP scans your font directories, "
"the best solution is to upgrade to a version of Fontconfig newer than 2.2.0. "

"A frequent source of confusion occurs on Windows systems, when GIMP "

"GIMP. </emphasis> When this happens, it often seems to users that GIMP has "
"crashed. It hasn't: closing the console window causes Windows to shut GIMP "
"down. Unfortunately, this annoying situation is caused by an interaction "
"between Windows and the libraries that GIMP links to: it cannot be fixed "
"within GIMP. All you need to do, though, if this happens, is minimize the "
