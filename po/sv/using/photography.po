"One of the most common uses of GIMP is to fix digital camera images that for "
"some reason are less than perfect. Maybe the image is overexposed or "
"underexposed; maybe rotated a bit; maybe out of focus: these are all common "
"problems for which GIMP has good tools. The purpose of this chapter is to "
"give you an overview of those tools and the situations in which they are "
"useful. You will not find detailed tutorials here: in most cases it is "
"easier to learn how to use the tools by experimenting with them than by "
"reading about them. (Also, each tool is described more thoroughly in the "
"Help section devoted to it.) You will also not find anything in this chapter "
"about the multitude of \"special effects\" that you can apply to an image "
"using GIMP. You should be familiar with basic GIMP concepts before reading "
"this chapter, but you certainly don't need to be an expert–if you are, you "
"probably know most of this anyway. And don't hesitate to experiment: GIMP's "

"line up precisely with the original pixels, the image inevitably gets "
"blurred a little bit. For a single rotation, the amount of blurring is quite "

"A good tool for removing dust and other types of lens grunge is the <link "
"linkend=\"plug-in-despeckle\">Despeckle</link> filter, accessed as Filters-"
"&gt;Enhance-&gt;Despeckle from the image menu. Very important: to use this "
"filter effectively, you must begin by making a small selection containing "
"the artifact and a small area around it. The selection must be small enough "
"so that the artifact pixels are statistically distinguishable from the other "
"pixels inside the selection. If you try to run despeckle on the whole image, "
"you will hardly ever get anything useful. Once you have created a reasonable "
"selection, activate Despeckle, and watch the preview as you adjust the "
"parameters. If you are lucky, you will be able to find a setting that "
"removes the junk while minimally affecting the area around it. The more the "
"junk stands out from the area around it, the better your results are likely "
"to be. If it isn't working for you, it might be worthwhile to cancel the "
"filter, create a different selection, and then try again."

"The most useful method for removing unwanted <quote>clutter</quote> from an "
"image is the <link linkend=\"gimp-tool-clone\">Clone</link><placeholder-1/> "
"tool, which allows you to paint over one part of an image using pixel data "
"taken from another part (or even from a different image). The trick to using "
"the clone tool effectively is to be able to find a different part of the "
"image that can be used to <quote>copy over</quote> the unwanted part: if the "
"area surrounding the unwanted object is very different from the rest of the "
"image, you won't have much luck. For example, if you have a lovely beach "
"scene, with a nasty human walking across the beach who you would like to "
"teleport away, you will probably be able to find an empty part of the beach "
"that looks similar to the part he is walking across, and use it to clone "
"over him. It is quite astonishing how natural the results can look when this "
"technique works well."
