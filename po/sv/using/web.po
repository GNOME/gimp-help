"An optimal image for the web depends upon the image type and the file format "

"online, you have to use <link linkend=\"file-jpeg-save\">JPEG</link> as your "
"primary file format. If your image contains fewer colors, that is, if it is "
"not a photograph, but is more a drawing you created (such as a button or a "
"screenshot), you would be better off using <link linkend=\"file-png-load"
