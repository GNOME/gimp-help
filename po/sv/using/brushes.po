"<quote>GIMP brushes</quote>. There are also many collections of brushes for "
"other programs with painting functionality. Some can be converted easily "
"into GIMP brushes, some require special conversion utilities, and some "
"cannot be converted at all. Most fancy procedural brush types fall into the "
"last category. If you need to know, look around on the web, and if you don't "
