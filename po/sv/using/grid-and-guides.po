"How can you create a grid that is actually part of the image? You can't do "
"this using the image grid: that is only an aid, and is only visible on the "
"monitor or in a screenshot. You can, however, use the <link linkend=\"plug-"
"in-grid\">Grid</link> plugin to render a grid very similar to the image "
"grid. (Actually, the plugin has substantially more options.)"
