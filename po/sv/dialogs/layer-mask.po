"A transparency mask can be added to each layer, it's called Layer mask. A "
"layer mask has the same size and same pixel number as the layer to which it "
"is attached. Every pixel of the mask can then be coupled with a pixel at the "
"same location in the layer. The mask is a set of pixels in gray-tone on a "
"value scale from 0 to 255. The pixels with a value 0 are black and give a "
"full transparency to the coupled pixel in the layer. The pixels with a value "
"255 are white and give a full opacity to the coupled pixel in the layer."
