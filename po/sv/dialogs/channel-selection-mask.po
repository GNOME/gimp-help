"Channels can be used to save and restore your selections. Clicking on the "
"<guilabel>Quick mask</guilabel> button on the <link linkend=\"gimp-image-"
"window\">Image window</link> automatically creates a new channel called "
"<guilabel>Qmask</guilabel> and saves the displayed active selection to a "
"thumbnail in front of the channel.There are many selection tools in GIMP "
"like rectangular selection tool or fuzzy selection for continuous "
"selections. Selection Masks are a graphical way to build selections into a "
"gray level channel where white pixels are selected and black pixels are not "
"selected. Therefore gray pixels are partially selected. You can think of "
"them as feathering the selection, a smooth transition between selected and "
"not selected. This is important to avoid the ugly pixelization effect when "
"you fill the selection or when you erase its content after isolating a "
"subject from background."

"are important. If you paint with some color other than white, grey, or "

"You can work in selection masks not only with the paint tool but also with "
"other tools. For instance, you can use the selection tools to fill areas "
"uniformly with gradients or patterns. By adding many selection masks in your "

"selection mask is to a selection as a layer is to an image."
