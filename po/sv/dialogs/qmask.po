"A <guilabel>Quick Mask</guilabel> is a <link linkend=\"dialogs-selection-"

"selection. Temporarily means that, unlike a normal selection mask, it will "
"be deleted from the channel list after its transformation to selection. The "
"<link linkend=\"gimp-tools-selection\">selection tools</link> sometimes show "
"their limits when they have to be used for doing complex drawing selection, "
"as progressive. In this case, using the QuickMask is a good idea which can "
"give very good results."

"To initialize a <guilabel>Quick Mask</guilabel>, click the bottom-left "
"button in the image window. If a selection was active in your image, then "
"its content appears unchanged while the border is covered with a translucent "
"red color. If no selection was active then all the image is covered with a "
"translucent red color. At every moment you can hide the mask by clicking on "
"the eye icon <placeholder-1/> in front of the <guilabel>QMask</guilabel>. "
"From the channel dialog you can double click on the name or the thumbnail to "
"edit the <guilabel>QMask</guilabel> attributes. Then you can change the "
"<guilabel>Opacity</guilabel> and its filling color. Once a quick mask is "
"initialized click on it to be sure it is selected and blue highlighted in "
"the list, and start to paint on it with any GIMP paint tool. The mask is "
"coded in gray tones, so you must use white or gray to decrease the area "
"limited by the mask and black to increase it. The area painted in light or "
"dark gray will be transition areas for the selection like feathering. When "
"your mask is ready, click again on the bottom-left button in the image "
"window and the quick mask will be removed from the channel list and "
"converted to a selection. Quick mask's purpose is to paint a selection and "
"its transitions with the paint tools without worrying about managing "
"selection masks. It's a good way to isolate a subject in a picture because "
"once the selection is made you only have to remove its content (or inverse "
"if the subject is in the selection)."
