"For displays there are two steps involved. One is called calibration and the "
"other is called profiling. Also, calibration generally involves two steps. "
"The first involves adjusting external monitor controls such as Contrast, "
"Brightness, Color Temperature, etc, and it is highly dependent on the "
"specific monitor. In addition there are further adjustments that are loaded "
"into the video card memory to bring the monitor as close to a standard state "
"as possible. This information is stored in the monitor profile in the so-"
"called vgct tag. Probably under Windows XP or Mac OS, the operating system "
"loads this information (LUT) in the video card in the process of starting "
"your computer. Under Linux, at present you have to use an external program "
"such as xcalib or dispwin. (If one just does a simple visual calibration "
"using a web site such as that of Norman Koren, one might only use xgamma to "
"load a gamma value.)"

"The second step, profiling, derives a set of rules which allow GIMP to "
"translate RGB values in the image file into appropriate colors on the "
"screen. This is also stored in the monitor profile. It doesn't change the "
"RGB values in the image, but it does change which values are sent to the "
"video card (which already contains the vgct LUT)."
