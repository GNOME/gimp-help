"Undo is performed on an image-specific basis: the \"Undo History\" is one of "
"the components of an image. GIMP allocates a certain amount of memory to "
"each image for this purpose. You can customize your Preferences to increase "
"or decrease the amount, using the <link linkend=\"gimp-prefs-environment"
"\">Environment</link> page of the Preferences dialog. There are two "
"important variables: the <emphasis>minimal number of undo levels</emphasis>, "
"which GIMP will maintain regardless of how much memory they consume, and the "
"<emphasis>maximum undo memory</emphasis>, beyond which GIMP will begin to "
"delete the oldest items from the Undo History."

"The implementation of Undo by GIMP is rather sophisticated. Many operations "
"require very little Undo memory (e.g., changing visibility of a layer), so "
"you can perform long sequences of them before they drop out of the Undo "
"History. Some operations (changing layer visibility is again an example) are "
"<emphasis>compressed</emphasis>, so that doing them several times in a row "
"produces only a single point in the Undo History. However, there are other "
"operations that may consume a lot of undo memory. Most filters are examples "
"of this: because they are implemented by plug-ins, the GIMP core has no "
"really efficient way of knowing what they have changed, so it has no way to "
"implement Undo except by memorizing the entire contents of the affected "
"layer before and after the operation. You might only be able to perform a "
"few such operations before they drop out of the Undo History."

"Most actions that alter an image can be undone. Actions that do not alter "

"without altering the underlying image data. The most important example is "
"zooming. There are, however, exceptions: toggling QuickMask on or off can be "

"The Undo History is a component of the image, so when the image is closed "

"Some tools require you to perform a complex series of manipulations before "

"individual elements. For example, the Intelligent Scissors require you to "
"create a closed path by clicking at multiple points in the image, and then "
"clicking inside the path to create a selection. You cannot undo the "
"individual clicks: undoing after you are finished takes you all the way back "
"to the starting point. For another example, when you are working with the "
"Text tool, you cannot undo individual letters, font changes, etc.: undoing "

"Filters, and other actions performed by plugins or scripts, can be undone "
"just like actions implemented by the GIMP core, but this requires them to "
"make correct use of GIMP's Undo functions. If the code is not correct, a "
"plugin can potentially corrupt the Undo History, so that not only the plugin "
"but also previous actions can no longer properly be undone. The plugins and "
"scripts distributed with GIMP are all believed to be set up correctly, but "
"obviously no guarantees can be given for plugins you obtain from other "
"sources. Also, even if the code is correct, canceling a plugin while it is "
"running can sometimes leave the Undo History corrupted, so it is best to "
"avoid this unless you have accidentally done something whose consequences "
"are going to be very harmful."
