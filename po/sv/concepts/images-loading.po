"When you open a file, using the File menu or any other method, "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> needs to determine what type of file it is. Unless "
"there is no alternative, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> does not simply rely on the "
"extension (such as \".jpg\") to determine the file type, because extensions "
"are not reliable: they vary from system to system; any file can be renamed "
"to have any extension; and there are many reasons why a file name might lack "
"an extension. Instead, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> first tries to recognize a "
"file by examining its contents: most of the commonly used graphics file "
"formats have \"magic headers\" that permit them to be recognized. Only if "
"the magic yields no result does <acronym>GIMP</acronym> resort to using the "
"extension."

"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.2 introduced a new File Chooser that provides "
"several features to help you navigate quickly to the file you are looking "
"for. Perhaps the most important is the ability to create <quote>bookmarks</"
"quote> for folders that you use often. Your list of bookmarks appears on the "
"left side of the dialog. The ones at the top ( <quote>Home</quote>, "
"<quote>Desktop</quote>, etc) come automatically; the others you create using "
"the <quote>Add</quote> button at the bottom of the list. Double-clicking on "
"a bookmark takes you straight to that directory."

"One thing that strikes many people when they first see the File Open dialog "

"<keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>L</keycap></keycombo> with the dialog "

"In the great majority of cases, if you select a file name from the list, and "

"dialog, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will automatically determine the file type "
"for you. On rare occasions, mainly if the file type is unusual and the name "
"lacks a meaningful extension, this may fail. If this happens, you can tell "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> specifically what type of file it is by expanding "
"the <quote>Select File Typ</quote> option at the bottom of the dialog, and "
"choosing an entry from the list that appears. More commonly, though, if "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> fails to open an image file, it is either corrupt or "
