"A <emphasis>brush</emphasis> is a pixmap or set of pixmaps used for "
"painting. GIMP includes a set of 10 \"paint tools\", which not only perform "
"operations that you would think of as painting, but also operations such as "
"erasing, copying, smudging, lightening or darkening, etc. All of the paint "
"tools, except the ink tool, use the same set of brushes. The brush pixmaps "
"represent the marks that are made by single \"touches\" of the brush to the "
"image. A brush stroke, usually made by moving the pointer across the image "
"with the mouse button held down, produces a series of marks spaced along the "
"trajectory, in a way specified by the characteristics of the brush and the "
"paint tool being used."
