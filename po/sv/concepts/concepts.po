"Images are the basic entities that <acronym>GIMP</acronym> works with. "
"Roughly speaking, an <quote>image</quote> corresponds to a single file, such "
"as a TIFF or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a "
"single display window, but this is not quite correct: it is possible to have "
"multiple windows all displaying the same image. It is not possible to have a "
"single window display more than one image, though, or for an image to have "
"no window displaying it."

"A <acronym>GIMP</acronym> image may be quite a complicated thing. Instead of "
"thinking of it as something like a sheet of paper with a picture on it, you "
"should think of it as more like a book, whose pages are called "
"<quote>layers</quote> In addition to a stack of layers, a <acronym>GIMP</"
"acronym> image may contain a selection mask, a set of channels, and a set of "
"paths. In fact, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> provides a mechanism for attaching "
"arbitrary pieces of data to an image, as which are called <quote>parasites</"

"In <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, it is possible to have many images open at the "

"but <acronym>GIMP</acronym> uses a sophisticated tile-based memory "
"management system that allows it to handle even very large images "
"gracefully. There are, however, limits, and it is usually beneficial when "
"working with images to put as much memory into your system as possible."

"If an image is like a book, then a layer is like a page within the book. The "
"simplest images only contain a single layer, and can be treated like single "
"sheets of paper, but sophisticated <acronym>GIMP</acronym> users often deal "
"with images containing many layers, even dozens of them. Layers need not be "
"opaque, and they need not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you "
"look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you "
"may see elements of many layers."

"In <acronym>GIMP</acronym> Channels are the smallest units of subdivision in "
"the stack of layers from which the image is constructed. Every Channel in a "
"layer has exactly the same size as the layer it belongs to and consequently "
"consists of the same pixels. Every pixel can be regarded as a container "
"which can be filled with a value ranging from 0 to 255. The exact meaning of "
"this value depends on the type of channel, e.g. in the <acronym>RGB</"
"acronym> color model the value in the <emphasis>R</emphasis>-channel means "
"the amount of red which is added to the colour of the different pixels, in "
"the selection channel the value denotes how strong the pixels are selected "
"and in the alpha channel the values denote how transparent the corresponding "
"pixels are."

"Often when you do something to an image, you only want a part of it to be "
"affected. The <quote>selection</quote> mechanism makes this possible. Each "
"image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line "
"separating the selected parts from the unselected parts (the so-called "
"<quote>marching ants</quote> ). Actually this is a bit misleading: selection "
"in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is really graded, not all-or-nothing, and really "
"the selection is represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel. The dashed "
"line that you normally see is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected "
"level. At any time, though, you can visualize the selection channel in all "
"its glorious detail by toggling the <link linkend=\"gimp-image-window-qmask-"

"A large component of learning how to use <acronym>GIMP</acronym> effectively "
"is acquiring the art of making good selectionsâ€”selections that contain "
"exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so "
"centrally important, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> gives you a large number of "
"tools for doing it: an assortment of selection-making tools, a menu of "
"selection operations, and the ability to switch to Quick Mask mode, in which "
"you can treat the selection channel as though it were a color channel, "
"thereby <quote>painting the selection</quote>"

"When you make mistakes, you can undo them. Nearly everything you can do to "
"an image is undoable. In fact, you can usually undo a substantial number of "
"the most recent things you did, if you decide that they were misguided. "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> makes this possible by keeping a history of your "
"actions. This history consumes memory, though, so undoability is not "
"infinite. Some actions use very little undo memory, so that you can do "
"dozens of them before the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other "
"types of actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure "
"the amount of memory <acronym>GIMP</acronym> allows for the undo history of "
"each image, but in any situation, you should always be able to undo at least "
"your 2-3 most recent actions. (The most important action that is not "
"undoable is closing an image. For this reason, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> asks "
"you to confirm that you really want to close the image if you have made any "
"changes to it.)"

"Many, probably most, of the things you do to an image in <acronym>GIMP</"

"<acronym>GIMP</acronym>, and are capable of manipulating images and other "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> objects in very sophisticated ways. Many important "
"plug-ins come packaged together with <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, but there are "
"also many available by other means. In fact, the ability to write plug-ins "

"In addition to plug-ins, which are programs written in the C language, GIMP "

"written in a language called Script-Fu, which is special to GIMP (for those "
"who care, it is a dialect of the Lisp-like language called Scheme). It is "
"also possible to write GIMP scripts in Python or Perl. These languages are "
"more flexible and powerful than Script-Fu; their disadvantage is that they "
"depend on software that does not automatically come packaged with GIMP, so "
"they are not guaranteed to work correctly in every GIMP installation."
