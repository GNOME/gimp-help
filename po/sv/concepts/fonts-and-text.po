"One of the greatest improvements of GIMP 2.0 over GIMP 1.2 is in the "
"handling of text. In GIMP 2.0 and 2.2, each text item goes in a separate "
"Text layer, and you can come back later to the layer and edit the text in "
"it. You can also move the text around in the image, or change the font, or "
"the font size. You can use any font available on your system. You can "
"control justification, indentation, and line spacing."

"To understand some of the idiosyncrasies of text handling, it may help for "
"you to realize that a text layer contains more information than the pixel "
"data that you see: it also contains a representation of the text in a text-"
"editor format. You can see this in the text-editor window that pops up while "
"you are using the Text tool. Every time you alter the text, the image layer "
"is redrawn to reflect your changes."

"Now suppose you create a text layer, and then operate on it in some way that "
"does not involve the Text tool: rotate it, for example. Suppose you then "
"come back and try to edit it using the Text tool. As soon as you edit the "

"message pops up, warning you that your alterations will be undone, and "
