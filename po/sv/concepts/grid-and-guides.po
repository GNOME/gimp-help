"You will probably have it happen many times that you need to place something "
"in an image very precisely, and find that it is not easy to do using a "
"mouse. Often you can get better results by using the arrow keys on the "
"keyboard (which move the affected object one pixel at a time, or 25 pixels "
"if you hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key), but GIMP also provides you "
"with two other aids to make positioning easier: grids and guides."

"In addition to the image grid, GIMP also gives you a more flexible type of "

"wherever you like. To move a guide after you have created it, activate the "
