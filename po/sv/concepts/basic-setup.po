"This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs used "
"by GIMP for various purposes, but users typically open them when they need "
"them and close them when they are done. Knowledgeable users generally keep "
"the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and Layers dialog around at all times. The "
"Toolbox is essential to many GIMP operations; in fact, if you close it, GIMP "
"will exit after confirming that that is actually what you want to do. The "
"Tool Options section is actually a separate dialog, shown docked to the Main "
"Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost always have it set up "
"this way: it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able "
"to see how their options are set. The Layers dialog comes into play whenever "
"you work with an image that has multiple layers: once you advance beyond the "
"very most basic stages of GIMP expertise, this means <emphasis>almost "
"always</emphasis>. And of course it helps to display the images you're "
"editing on the screen; if you close the image window before saving your "
"work, GIMP will ask you whether you want to close the file."

"Unlike some other programs, GIMP does not give you the option of putting all "
"your controls and image displays into a single comprehensive window. The "
"GIMP developers have always felt that this is a poor way of working, because "
"it forces the program to do the work of a dedicated window manager. Not only "
"would this waste a lot of programmer time, it is almost impossible to do in "
"a way that works correctly across all of the operating systems GIMP is "
"intended to run on."

"Earlier versions of GIMP (up to GIMP 1.2.5) were very profligate with "
"dialogs: advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at once, "
"scattered all over the screen and very difficult to keep track of. GIMP 2.0 "
"is much better in this respect, because it allows dialogs to be docked "
"together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot actually "
"contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels, Paths, and "
"Undo.) The system takes a little while to learn, but once you learn it, we "
"hope that you will like it."

"The following sections will walk you through the components of each of the "

"GIMP images, you should have learned enough to use GIMP for a wide variety "
"of basic image manipulations. You can then look through the rest of the "
"manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the almost limitless "
"number of more subtle and specialized things that are possible. Have fun!"
