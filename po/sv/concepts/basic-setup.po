"This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs used "
"by GIMP for various purposes, but users typically create them when they are "
"needed and close them when they are not. Knowledgeable users generally keep "
"the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and Layers dialog around at all times. The "
"Toolbox is essential to many GIMP operations; in fact, if you close it, GIMP "
"will exit. (You are asked to confirm that you want to do this, though.) The "
"Tool Options are actually a separate dialog, shown docked to the Main Toolbox "
"in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost always have them set up this "
"way: it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to see "
"how their options are set. The Layers dialog comes into play whenever you "
"work with an image that has multiple layers: once you advance beyond the very "
"most basic stages of GIMP expertise, this means <emphasis>almost always</"
"emphasis>. And finally, of course, the necessity of having images displayed "
"in order to work with them is perhaps obvious."

"Unlike some other programs, GIMP does not give you the option of putting "
"everything—controls and image displays—all into a single comprehensive "
"window. GIMP developers have always felt that this is a poor way of working, "
"because it forces the program to perform a wide range of functions that are "
"much better done by a dedicated window manager. Not only would this waste a "
"lot of programmer time, it is almost impossible to do in a way that works "
"correctly across all of the operating systems GIMP is intended to run on."

"Earlier versions of GIMP (up to GIMP 1.2.5) were very profligate with "
"dialogs: advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at once, "
"scattered all over the screen and very difficult to keep track of. GIMP 2.0 "
"is much better in this respect, because it allows dialogs to be docked "
"together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot actually "
"contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels, Paths, and "
"Undo.) The system takes a little while to learn, but once you learn it, we "
"hope that you will like it."

"The following sections will walk you through the components of each of the "

"GIMP images, you should have learned enough to use GIMP for a wide variety of "
"basic image manipulations. You can then look through the rest of the manual "
"at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the almost limitless number of "
"more subtle and specialized things that are possible. Have fun!"
