"One of the nicest things about <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is how easily its "
"functionality can be extended, by using plugins. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> "
"plugins are external programs that run under the control of the main "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> application and interact with it very closely. "
"Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their "
"advantage is that it is much easier to add a capability to <acronym>GIMP</"
"acronym> by writing a small plugin than by modifying the huge mass of complex "
"code that makes up the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> core. Many valuable plugins "
"have C source code that only comes to 100-200 lines or so."

"Anybody in the world can write a <acronym>GIMP</acronym> plugin and make it "

"many very valuable plugins can be obtained in this way ­ some are described "
"elsewhere in the User's Manual. With this freedom from constraint comes a "
"certain degree of risk, though: the fact that anybody can do it means that "
"there is no effective quality control. The plugins distributed with "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> have all been tested and tuned by the developers, but "
"many that you can download were just hacked together in a few hours and then "
"tossed to the winds. Some plugin creators just don't care about robustness, "
"and even for those who do, their ability to test on a variety of systems in a "
"variety of situations is often quite limited. Basically, when you download a "
"plugin, you are getting something for free, and sometimes you get exactly "

"Because of the way plugins communicate with <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, they do "
"not have any mechanism for being informed about changes you make to an image "
"after the plugin has been started. If you start a plugin, and then alter the "
"image using some other tool, the plugin will often crash, and when it doesn't "
"will usually give a bogus result. You should avoid running more than one "
"plugin at a time on an image, and avoid doing anything to the image until the "
"plugin has finished working on it. If you ignore this advice, not only will "
