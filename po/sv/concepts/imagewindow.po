"In GIMP, each image that you have open is displayed in its own separate "
"window. (In some cases, multiple windows may all display the same image, but "
"this is unusual.) We will begin with a brief description of the components "
"that are present by default in an ordinary image window. Some of these, in "
"fact, can be made to disappear using commands in the <link linkend=\"gimp-"
"imagewindow-menus-view\">View</link> menu; but you will probably find that "
"you don't want to do that."

"<emphasis>Title Bar:</emphasis> At the top of the image window you will "
"probably see a emphasis bar, showing the name of the image and some basic "
"information about it. The emphasis bar is actually provided by the windowing "
"system, not by GIMP itself, so its appearance may vary with different "
"operating systems, window managers, and/or themes. In the <link linkend="
"\"gimp-prefs-dialog\">Preferences dialog</link> you can customize the "
"information that appears here, if you want to."

"<emphasis>Image Menu:</emphasis> Directly below the emphasis bar appears the "
"Image Menu (unless it has been suppressed). This menu gives you access to "
"nearly every operation you can perform on an image. (There are some "
"<quote>global</quote> actions that can only be accessed via the Toolbox "
"menu.) You can also get the Image Menu by right-clicking inside the image "
"<placeholder-1/> , or by left-clicking on the little <quote>arrow</quote> "
"symbol in the upper left corner, if for some reason you find one of these "
"more convenient. More: most menu operations can also be activated from the "
"keyboard, using Alt plus an <quote>accelerator</quote> key underlined in the "
"menu emphasis. More: you can define your own custom shortcuts for menu "
"actions, if you enable <link linkend=\"gimp-prefs-interface\"> Use Dynamic "
"Keyboard Shortcuts</link> in the Preferences dialog."

"<emphasis>Ruler:</emphasis> In the default layout, rulers are shown above "
"and to the left of the image, indicating coordinates within the image. You "
"can control what type of coordinates are shown if you want to. By default, "
"pixels are used, but you can change to other units, using the Units setting "
"described below."

"One of the most important uses of rulers is to create <emphasis>guides</"

"guideline will be created, which you can use to help you position things "
"accurately. Guides can be moved by clicking on them and dragging, or deleted "
"by dragging them out of the image display."

"<emphasis>QuickMask Toggle:</emphasis> At the lower left corner of the image "
"display is a small button that toggles on or off the Quick Mask, which is an "
"alternate, and often extremely useful, way of viewing the selected area "
"within the image. For more details see <link linkend=\"gimp-qmask"
"\">QuickMask</link>."

"<emphasis>Pointer Coordinates:</emphasis> In the lower left corner of the "
"window is a rectangular area used to show the current pointer coordinates "
"(that is, the mouse location, if you are using a mouse), whenever the "
"pointer is within the image boundaries. The units are the same as for the "
"rulers."

"<emphasis>Units menu:</emphasis> By default, the units used for the rulers "
"and several other purposes are pixels. You can change to inches, cm, or "
"several other possibilities using this menu. (If you do, note that the "
"setting of <quote>Dot for dot</quote> in the View menu affects how the "

"<emphasis>Status Area:</emphasis> The Status Area appears below the image "
"display. Most of the time, by default, it shows which part of the image is "
"currently active, and the amount of system memory that the image is "
"consuming. You can customize the information that appears here, by changing "
"your Preferences. When you perform time-consuming operations, the status "
"area changes temporarily to show what operation is being performed, and its "
"state of progress."
msgstr ""

#: src/concepts/imagewindow.xml:164(para)
msgid ""
"Note that the amount of memory consumed by the image is quite different from "
"the image file size. For instance, a 69.7Kb .PNG image will occupy 246Kb in "
"memory when displayed. Two reasons for that. First, image is reconstituted "
"from the compressed .PNG file. Then, GIMP keeps a copy of the image in "
"memory to be used by the Undo command."

"<emphasis>Cancel Button:</emphasis> At the lower right corner of the window "
"appears the Cancel button. If you start a complex, time-consuming operation "
"(most commonly a plug-in), and then decide, while it is being computed, that "
"you didn't really want to do it after all, this button will cancel it "
"immediately."

"<emphasis>Navigation control:</emphasis> This is a small cross-shaped button "
"at the lower right corner of the image display. Clicking on it, and holding "
"the left mouse button down, brings up a window showing a miniature view of "
"the image (Navigation Preview), with the displayed area outlined. You can "
"pan to a different part of the image by moving the mouse while keeping the "
"button depressed. For large images of which only a small part is displayed, "
"the navigation window is often the most convenient way of getting to the "
"part of the image you are looking for. (See <link linkend=\"gimp-navigation-"
"dialog\">Navigation Dialog</link> for other ways to access the Navigation "
"Window). (If your mouse has a middle-button, click-drag with it to span "

"<emphasis>Image Display:</emphasis> The most important part of the image "

"boundary, against a neutral gray background. You can change the zoom level "
"of the image display in a variety of ways, including the Zoom setting "
"described below."
