"The <link linkend=\"gimp-tools-selection\">selection tools</link> sometimes "

"selection. In these cases, using the QuickMask can make things much easier. "
"Simply put, the QuickMask allows you to paint a selection instead of just "
"tracing its outline."

"Normally when you create a selection in GIMP, you see it represented by the "
"\"marching ants\" that trace along its outline. But really there may be a "
"lot more to a selection than the marching ants show you: in GIMP a selection "
"is actually a full-fledged grayscale channel, covering the image, with pixel "
"values ranging from 0 (unselected) to 255 (fully selected). The marching "
"ants are drawn along a contour of half-selected pixels. Thus, what the "
"marching ants show you as either inside or outside the boundary is really "
"just a slice through a continuum."

"The QuickMask is GIMP's way of showing you the full structure of the "
"selection. Activating it also gives you the ability to interact with the "
"selection in new, and substantially more powerful, ways. To activate the "
"QuickMask, click on the small red-outlined button at the lower left of the "
"image window. The button is a toggle, so clicking it again will return you "
"to normal marching-ant mode. You can also activate the QuickMask by "
"selecting in the image window menu <menuchoice><guimenu>Select</"
"guimenu><guimenuitem>Toggle QuickMask</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or by "
"using the <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo> "

"Activating the QuickMask shows you the selection as though it were a "
"translucent screen overlying the image, whose transparency at each pixel "
"indicates the degree to which that pixel is selected. By default the mask is "
"shown in red, but you can change this if another mask color would be more "
"convenient. The less a pixel is selected, the more it is obscured by the "
"mask. Fully selected pixels are shown completely clear."

"When you are in QuickMask mode, many image manipulations act on the "
"selection channel rather than the image itself. This includes, in "
"particular, paint tools. Painting with white causes the painted pixels to be "
"selected; painting with black causes them to be unselected. You can use any "
"of the paint tools, as well as the bucket fill and gradient fill tools, in "
"this way. Advanced users of GIMP learn that <quote>painting the selection</"
"quote> is the easiest and most effective way to delicately manipulate it."
