msgid "In the Toolbox, as in most parts of GIMP, moving the mouse on top of something and letting it rest for a moment will usually bring up a \"tooltip\" message that may help you understand what the thing is or what you can do with it. Also, in many cases you can press the <keycap>F1</keycap> key to get help about the thing that is underneath the mouse."

msgid "<emphasis>Tool icons:</emphasis> These icons are buttons which activate tools for a wide variety of purposes: selecting parts of images, painting on them, transforming them, etc. The <link linkend=\"gimp-toolbox-introduction\">Toolbox Introduction</link> section gives an overview of how to work with tools, and each tool is described systematically in the <link linkend=\"gimp-toolbox\">Tools</link> chapter."

msgid "<emphasis>Foreground/Background colors:</emphasis> The color areas here show you GIMP's current foreground and background colors, which come into play in many operations. Clicking on either one of them brings up a color selector dialog that allows you to change to a different color. Clicking on the double-headed arrow swaps the two colors, and clicking on the small symbol in the lower left corner resets them to black and white."

#: src/concepts/toolbox.xml:75(para)
msgid "<emphasis>Brush/Pattern/Gradient:</emphasis> The symbols here show you <acronym>GIMP's</acronym> current selections for: the Paintbrush, used by all tools that allow you to paint on the image (<quote>painting</quote> includes operations like erasing and smudging, by the way); for the Pattern, which is used in filling selected areas of an image; and for the Gradient, which comes into play whenever an operation requires a smoothly varying range of colors. Clicking on any of these symbols brings up a dialog window that allows you to change it."

msgid "<emphasis>Active Image:</emphasis> In <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you can work with many images at once, but at any given moment, one of them is the <quote>active image</quote>. Here you find a small iconic representation of the active image. Clicking on it brings up a dialog with a list of all the currently open images, allowing you to make a different one active if you want to. (Clicking on the window where the image is displayed will accomplish the same thing, though.)"

msgid "At every start, GIMP selects a tool (the brush), a color, a brush and a pattern by default, always the same.
