"The <guimenuitem>Flatten Image</guimenuitem> command merges all of the "
"layers of the image into a single layer with no alpha channel. After the "
"image is flattened, it has the same appearance it had before. The difference "
"is that all of the image contents are in a single layer without "
"transparency. If there are any areas which are transparent through all of "
"the layers of the original image, the background color is visible."
