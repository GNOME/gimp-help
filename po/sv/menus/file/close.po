"Closing an image is not undoable: once it is closed, everything is gone, "
"including the undo history. If the image is not <quote>clean</quote> — that "
"is, if you have changed it since the last time you saved it — you are asked "
"to confirm that you really want to close it. Note that an image is marked as "
"clean when it is saved to a file, even if the file format chosen does not "
"preserve all the information in the image, so it is a good idea to think for "
"a moment about what you are doing before closing an image. If there is the "
"slightest possibility that you will regret it, it can't hurt to save a copy "
"as an <link linkend=\"glossary-xcf\">XCF</link> file."
