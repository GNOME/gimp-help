"The <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem> command merges the active layer "
"with the layer just below it in the stack, taking into account the various "
"properties of the active layer, such as its opacity and layer <link linkend="
"\"gimp-concepts-layer-modes\">mode</link>. The resulting merged layer will "
"be in Normal mode, and will inherit the opacity of the layer below. If the "
"layer below is not opaque, or if it is in some mode other than Normal, then "

"The most common use of <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem> is to construct "
"a layer, by starting with a <quote>base layer</quote> (usually opaque and in "
"Normal mode, so that you can see what you are doing), and adding a "
"<quote>modification layer</quote> on top of it, with whatever shape, "
"opacity, and layer mode you need. In this case, merging down the "
"modification layer will combine the two layers into one, without changing "
"the way the image looks."
