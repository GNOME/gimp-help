"The Color to Alpha command makes transparent all pixels of the active layer "
"that have a selected color. An Alpha channel is created. It will attempt to "
"preserve anti-aliasing information by using a partially intelligent routine "
"that replaces weak color information with weak alpha information. In this "
"way, areas that contain an element of the selected color will maintain a "
"blended appearance with their surrounding pixels."
