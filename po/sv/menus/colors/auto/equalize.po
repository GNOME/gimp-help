"The <guimenuitem>Equalize</guimenuitem> command automatically adjusts the "
"brightness of colors across the active layer so that the histogram for the "
"Value channel is as nearly flat as possible, that is, so that each possible "
"brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as every other "
"value. You can see this in the histograms in the example below, in that "
"pixel colors which occur frequently in the image are stretched further apart "
"than pixel colors which occur only rarely. The results of this command can "
"vary quite a bit. Sometimes <quote>Equalize</quote> works very well to "
"enhance the contrast in an image, bringing out details which were hard to "
"see before. Other times, the results look very bad. It is a very powerful "
"operation and it is worth trying to see if it will improve your image. It "
"works on layers from RGB and Grayscale images. If the image is Indexed, the "
"menu entry is insensitive and grayed out."
