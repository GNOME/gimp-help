"Normally, each time you run an interactive plug-in, its dialog is displayed "
"with all of the settings initialized to the ones you used the last time you "
"ran it. This may be a problem if you made a mistake setting the values and "
"you can't remember what they were originally. One way to recover is to exit "
"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> and start again, but the <guimenuitem>Reset all "
"Filters</guimenuitem> command is a slightly less drastic solution: it resets "
"the values for <emphasis>all</emphasis> plug-ins to their defaults. Because "
"it is a dramatic step, it asks you to confirm that you really want to do it. "
"Be careful: you cannot undo this command."
