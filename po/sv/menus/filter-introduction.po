"In <acronym>GIMP</acronym> terminology, a <emphasis>filter</emphasis> is a "
"plug-in that modifies the appearance of an image, in most cases just the "
"active layer of the image. Not all of the entries in this menu meet that "
"definition, however; the word <quote>filter</quote> is often mis-used to "
"mean any plug-in, regardless of what it does. Indeed, some of the entries in "

"appearance of this menu can be completely different for each user. In "
"practice, though, the appearance does not vary very much, because most plug-"
"ins come with <acronym>GIMP</acronym> when it is installed, and of course "
