"The <guimenuitem>New View</guimenuitem> command creates a new image window "
"for the current image, which you can set up differently from the existing "
"display. You can create multiple views of any image, which are "
"numbered .1, .2, etc., but only the zoom factor and other viewing options "
"may be different. Any changes, other than viewing changes, which you make in "
"one window also appear in the other displays which show the same image. The "
"new views are not separate image files; they are simply different aspects of "
"the same image. You might use multiple views, for example, if you were "
"working on individual pixels at a high zoom factor. You could then see the "
"effects your changes would have on the image at a normal size."
