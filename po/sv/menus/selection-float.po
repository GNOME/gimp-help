"In early versions of <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, floating selections were used "
"for performing operations on a limited part of an image. You can do that "
"more easily now with layers, but you can still use this way of working with "
"images. In addition to using the <guimenuitem>Float</guimenuitem> command, "
"you also automatically create a floating selection by click-and-dragging a "

"You cannot perform any operations on other layers if the image has a "
"floating selection, so after you make the changes you want to the floating "
"selection, you have to <emphasis>anchor</emphasis> it. That is, you have to "
"attach it to a normal (non-floating) layer, usually the original layer (the "
"one which was active previously). To anchor the floating selection, use the "
"<link linkend=\"gimp-layer-anchor\">Anchor Layer</link> command. You can "
"also anchor it to an existing layer by clicking anywhere on the image "
"outside of the floating selection, which then merges it with the background "
"layer. You can also anchor it to a new layer by using the <link linkend="
"\"gimp-layer-new\">New Layer</link> command."

"If you display the layer boundary by using the <link linkend=\"gimp-view-"

"difficulty selecting a precise area of the image which you want in a layer. "
"To avoid this problem, you can make a rectangular selection, transform it "
"into a floating selection and anchor it to a new layer. Then simply remove "
"the original layer."
