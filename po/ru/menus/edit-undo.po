"If you have made drawing or editing changes to the image which you don't want "
"to keep, the <guimenu>Undo</guimenu> command allows you to undo the last "
"change and return the image to its previous state. Almost anything you do to "
"an image can be undone in this way (with the exception of scripts, which "
"deactivate this function). Further Undo operations may be performed, "
"depending upon the number of Undo levels configured in the <link linkend="
