"The <guimenuitem>New View</guimenuitem> command creates a new image window "
"for the current image, which you can set up differently from the existing "
"display. You can create multiple views of any image, which are "
"numbered .1, .2, etc., but only the zoom factor and other viewing options may "
"be different. Any changes, other than viewing changes, which you make in one "
"window also appear in the other displays which show the same image. The new "
"views are not separate image files; they are simply different aspects of the "
"same image. You might use multiple views, for example, if you were working on "
"individual pixels at a high zoom factor. You could then see the effects your "
"changes would have on the image at a normal size."
