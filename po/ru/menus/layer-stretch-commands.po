"<acronym>GIMP</acronym> has several automatic commands for stretching the "
"columns of the histogram for the color channels of the active layer. By "
"pushing bright pixels to the right and dark pixels to the left, they make "
"bright pixels brighter and dark pixels darker, which enhances the contrast in "
"the layer."
