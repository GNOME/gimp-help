"This usually means that the filter or option cannot be applied when your "

"<emphasis>Grayscale</emphasis> - In case you want to convert your brilliant "
"color image to something that's black and white (with a lot of shades of "
"grey), this is one of the easiest ways in which to do it. Some photos do "
"look a lot fancier when displayed in grayscale. Again, if you're interested "
"in some detail, this is achieved by taking the RGB values at the pixels in "
"your image, and suitably weighted averaging them to get an intensity at that "
"point."
