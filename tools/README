These tools should make your documentation life easier:

show_translation_progress.py
                    This script shows statistics about the percentage
                    of the help-ids done.
                    It can also tell you which help-ids do not have a
                    corresponding help document and can show inconsistencies
                    between help-ids and their filenames.
                    Run with -h option to see how to use it.

validate_references.py
                    Validates the references to image files in the
                    XML files.
                    Run with -h option to see how to use it.

check_image_resolutions.sh
                    A simple shell script to find images with resolution
                    != 144x144 dpi.

get_po_status.pl    This Perl script searches for po files in the specified
                    directory and prints statistics about translation
                    progress as well as a short summary (number of files
                    and strings, number of translated, fuzzy, or
                    untranslated strings).

translated_percentage.py
                    Generates info about what percentage of each available
                    language has been translated. Written in a format that we
                    can use when generating the website.

validate_po.py      Validates correct use of XML tags and other possible causes
                    of problems in po files.
                    Note that currently only the translated messages are
                    validated, not the original English message.


show_translation_progress.py
============================

This script parses the gimp-help.xml which has been generated during
transformation from DocBook/XML to HTML. It compares the ids with the
gimphelp-ids.h header file located in the gimp source tree and creates
statistics.
It can tell you which help-ids do not have a corresponding help
document and (option -i) can show inconsistencies between help-ids
and their filenames.
Note: we should probably rename this script since it is not really
about progress in translations as progress in written help manual
pages. Maybe: show_manual_progress.py

Requirements:
    - Path to GIMP sources (option -g)
    - For best results also set the paths to the gimp-help
      sources and the gimp-help build root (options -x and -b).

Call the script like this (adjust paths as necessary):

    python tools/show_translation_progress.py -g ../gimp -x . -b ../build/gimp-help


validate_references.py
======================

Call the script from the gimp-help root:

    python tools/validate_references.py

Use the --help option for more information.


get_po_status.pl
================

This Perl script searches for po files in the specified directory
and prints statistics about translation progress as well as a
short summary (number of files and strings, number of translated,
fuzzy, or untranslated strings).

Requirements:
    - Perl
    - msgfmt (package "gettext" or "gettext-runtime")

Usage:
    Call the script from the gimp-help root:

        tools/get_po_status.pl [options] po-directory

Options:
        --[no]files       [Don't] print file statistics
        --[no]summary     [Don't] print summary
        --[no]progress    [Don't] print "progress" bar
        --todo            Only print files with untranslated messages
        --lang LANG       Add language "LANG" for naming the progress bar

Use "perldoc tools/get_po_status.pl" for more information.


check_image_resolutions.sh
==========================

A simple shell script to find images with resolution != 144x144 dpi.

Requirements:
    - identify (from the ImageMagick package: http://www.imagemagick.org)
    - awk

Usage:
    tools/check_image_resolutions.sh DIR [DIR ...]


translated_percentage.py
========================

Generates info about what percentage of each available language has been
translated. Written in a format that we can use when generating the website.

Requirements:
    - msgfmt needs to be available

Usage: translated_percentage.py [options]

    options:
        -o      --output          default: ../web/langstats.xml
        -p      --podir           default: ../po
        -q      --quickreference  handle quickreference po files
        -v      --verbose         be more verbose
        -h      --help            this help""")


validate_po.py
==============

Validates correct use of XML tags and other possible causes of problems in
po files.
Note that currently only the translated messages are validated, not the
original English message.

Requirements:
    - polib

Usage: validate_po.py [options] POFILES

    options:
        -v      --verbose       be more verbose
        -w      --warnings      show warnings
        -h      --help          this help""")


xml_helper.py
=============
Removed since multi-language XML documentation was ended long ago.
Translations are now in separate po files.


check_lang_attributes.pl
==========================

Removed after changing to gettext-based documentation.


check_keywords_property.pl
==========================

Removed, we do not need "svn:keywords" any more
(and "git" won't support them).
