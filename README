Structure of the Documentation
------------------------------

Before you start working on documentation, we should think about the
structure of the GimpDocs itself. I make this proposal according to the
existing GUM, which is delivered with the GIMP 1.2. Please feel free to add
terms and modify this structure.

   1. Introduction
   2. Using GIMP
   3. Image
   4. Layers
   5. Channels
   6. Paths
   7. Tools
   8. Files
   9. Dialogs
  10. Gimp Filters 

Structure of a document
-----------------------

A document which describes a tool or something else of the GIMP, should
follow a structure which should be the same on all documents. If a
structure isn't necessary, because this tool or function has nothing for
this section to document, than the section shouldn't be written.

   1. Screenshot
   2. Tool activation
   3. Key modifiers
   4. Options
