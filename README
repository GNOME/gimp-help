Tips for contribution
---------------------

Write a mail to one of the authors (have a look at the file AUTHORS).
They should know what tasks need to be done and can find something to
do for you. You should subscribe to the gimp mailing lists to get up
to date information of the current GIMP development.

  What you should know
  --------------------

  You should know a bit about Docbook and XML, or be smart enough to learn
  the syntax yourself. You can get more information about Docbook and XML
  under the Links.

  Editors, Programs and Setups
  ----------------------------

  Use any editor you want, but you should handle it well. Please keep in
  mind, that the tab width in XML Mode should be 2 spaces. If you send us
  a patch, create the diff as a unified diff by typing

    cvs diff -pu > help.patch 

  from your gimp-help-2 directory.

  Provided you have xmllint installed, you can check the
  well-formedness of the XML files by running

    make lint

  and validate the XML by running

    make validate


  Hints for making good screenshots
  ---------------------------------

  * please make screenshots only with the system default theme, which
    is of course just the plain gtk+ default look
  * use default fonts like Bitstream Vera Sans
  * crop the window manager borders
  * provide your source images (eg. for making new screenshots in other
    languages)
