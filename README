  What you should know
  --------------------

  You should know a bit about Docbook and XML, or be smart enough to learn
  the syntax yourself. You can get more information about Docbook and SGML
  under the Links.

  Editors, Programs and Setups
  ----------------------------

  Use any editor you want, but you should handle it well. Please keep in
  mind, that the tab width in XML Mode should be 2 spaces. If you send us a
  patch, create the diff as a unified diff:

    cvs diff -pu -help > help.patch 

  or if you have the CvsRc in place:

    cvs diff -help > help.patch 

  in your gimp-help-2 directory.
