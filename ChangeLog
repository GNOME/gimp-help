	* configure.in: Check for the the recommended version of the DocBook
	Modular Stylesheets in src/ (currently 1.53.0) and use it if available.
	We still check for the stylesheets on the system if it's not there
	but this is deprecated since it may lead to severe problems. If no
	local stylesheets can be found we'll download the recommended version
	from a sourceforge mirror and store it in src/ for later use.
