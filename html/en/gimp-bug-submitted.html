          </div>

      <p>
      At any time after it is submitted, a bug report has a
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Status</span>”</span>
      that describes how it is currently being handled.  Here are the
      possible values of <span class="emphasis"><em>Status</em></span> and what they mean:
    </p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Unconfirmed</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This is the initial status of a bug report, from the time it is
            submitted until one of the maintainers reads it and decides
            whether it is really a valid bug report. Sometimes the maintainers
            aren't sure, and in the meantime leave the status as
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Unconfirmed</span>”</span>. In the worst cases, a bug report can
            stay
            unconfirmed for a year or longer, but this is considered a bad
            thing and does not happen very often.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">New</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This means that the bug report has been read by one of the
            maintainers, and is considered, for the moment at least, to be
            valid. It does not necessarily mean that anything is going to be
            done about it immediately: some bug reports, especially
            enhancement requests, may be perfectly valid and still go for a
            long time before anybody is able to deal with them. Many bugs, on
            the other hand, are fixed within hours of being reported.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Assigned</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This means that a specific person has agreed to work on the bug.
            It does not, this world being the kind of world that it is, mean
            that that person will actually <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
            anything in particular, so for practical purposes this status
            means nearly the same thing as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">New</span>”</span>.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Reopened</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This means that the bug report was at some point considered by the
            maintainers to be resolved (i.e., finished), but new information
            came in that caused them to change their minds: most likely, a
            change that was intended to fix the problem did not completely
            work.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Needinfo</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This is a status you should pay particular attention to. It means
            that you did not supply enough information in your bug report to
            enable anything to be done about it. In most cases, no further
            action will be taken on the bug report until you supply additional
            information (by adding a comment). If too much time goes by
            without any input from you, the bug report will eventually be
            resolved as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Incomplete</span>”</span>.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Resolved</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            This means that the maintainers believe that they have finished
            dealing with the bug report. If you disagree, you can re-open it,
            but since you cannot force anybody to work on a bug against their
            will, you should have a good reason for doing so. Bugs can be
            resolved in a variety of ways. Here are the possible values of
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Resolution</em></span> and what they mean:
          </p>
            <div class="variablelist">
              <dl class="variablelist">
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Fixed</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  The bug report is considered valid, and
                  <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> has been
                  changed in a way that is considered to fix it.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Wontfix</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  The maintainers agree that the bug report is valid, but it
                  would take so much effort to fix, in relation to its
                  importance, that it is not worth the trouble.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Duplicate</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  This means that the same bug has already been reported by
                  somebody else. If you see this resolution, you will also see
                  a pointer to the earlier bug report, which will often give
                  you a lot of useful information.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Notabug</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  This means that the behavior described in the bug
                  report is intentional. It may seem like a bug to you
                  (and there may be many people who agree with you), but
                  the program is working the way it was intended to
                  work,  and the developers don't want to change it.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">NotGnome</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  The bug report is valid, but it can't be addressed by
                  changing <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>. Problems in operating
                  systems, window managers, or libraries that
                  <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> depends on will often be
                  given this resolution. Sometimes the next appropriate step
                  is to file a bug report for the software that is really at
                  fault.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Incomplete</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  The bug report did not contain enough information for
                  anything to be done about it, and the reporter did not
                  respond to requests for more information. Usually a bug
                  report will be open for at least a month or two before it is
                  resolved in this way.
                </p>
                </dd>
                <dt>
                  <span class="term">Invalid</span>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
                  Something is wrong with the form of the bug report: most
                  commonly, the reporter has accidentally submitted the same
                  bug report multiple times. (This can easily happen by
                  mistake with some web browsers.) Bug reports that
                  incorrectly describe how the program behaves may also be
                  resolved as Invalid.

              If you disagree with the resolution of a bug report, you are
              always free to add your comments to it. Any comment added to any
              bug report, resolved or not, causes email to be sent to the
              <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
              Bugzilla mailing list, so it will at least be seen by the
              maintainers. This does not, of course, mean that they will
              necessarily respond to it.
