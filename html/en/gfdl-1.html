      This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
      contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
      work under the conditions stated herein. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Document</span>”</span>,
      below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is
      a licensee, and is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>.
      You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
      way requiring permission under copyright law.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-mod-ver"></a>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Modified Version</span>”</span>
      of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of
      it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into
      another language.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-secnd-sect"></a>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Secondary Section</span>”</span>
      is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
      exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and
      contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
      (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
      Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a
      matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
      matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
      position regarding them.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-inv-sect"></a>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Invariant Sections</span>”</span>
      are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being
      those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document
      is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
      definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
      Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
      Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-cov-text"></a>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cover Texts</span>”</span> are certain short passages of text that
      are listed,
      as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
      that the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text
      may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-transparent"></a>
      A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span>
      copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a
      format whose specification is available to the general public, that is
      suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text
      editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or
      (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
      variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
      an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
      has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
      readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used
      for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span> is called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Opaque</span>”</span>.
    </p>
      <p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
      without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
      using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-title-page"></a>
      The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span> means, for a printed book, the title
      page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
      material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
      works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span>
      means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
      title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    </p>
      <p><a id="gfdl-entitled"></a>
      A section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> means a named subunit of the
      Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
      parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language.
      (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgements</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>.) To
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Preserve the Title</span>”</span> of such a section when you modify
      the Document means that it remains a section
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> according to this definition.
    </p>
      <p>
      The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
      states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.
