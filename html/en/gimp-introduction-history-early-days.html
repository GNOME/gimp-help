            <p>
            Version 0.54 was released in February 1996, and had a major impact
            as the first truly professional free image manipulation program.
            This was the first free program that could compete with the big
            commercial image manipulation programs.
          </p>
            <p>
            Version 0.54 was a beta release, but it was so stable that you
            could use it for daily work. However, one of the major drawbacks
            of 0.54 was that the toolkit (the slidebars, menus, dialog boxes,
            etc.) was built on Motif, a commercial
            toolkit. This was a big drawback for systems like
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Linux</span>”</span>, because you had to buy
            Motif if you wanted to use the faster,
            dynamically linked <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>. Many
            developers were also students running Linux,
            who could not afford to buy Motif.

            <span class="term">Version 0.60</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            When 0.60 was released in July 1996, it had been under S and P
            (Spencer and Peter) development for four months. Main programming
            advantages were the new toolkits, <acronym class="acronym">GTK</acronym>
            (<acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> Toolkit) and <acronym class="acronym">gdk</acronym>
            (<acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> Drawing Kit), which eliminated the
            reliance on Motif. For the
            graphic artist, 0.60 was full of new features like: basic layers;
            improved painting tools (sub-pixel sampling, brush spacing); a
            better airbrush; paint modes; etc.
          </p>
            <p>
            Version 0.60 was only a developer's release, and was not intended
            for widespread use. It served as a workbench for 0.99 and the
            final 1.0 version, so functions and enhancement could be tested
            and dropped or changed. You can look at 0.60 as the alpha version
            of 0.99.
          </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">Version 0.99</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
            In February 1997, 0.99 came on the scene. Together with other
            developers, S and P had made several changes to
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> and added
            even more features. The main difference was the new API
            (Application Programming Interface) and the
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">PDB</span>”</span>, which made it possible to write scripts;
            Script-Fus (or
            macros) could now automate things that you would normally do by
            hand. <acronym class="acronym">GTK/gdk</acronym> had also changed and was now
            called <acronym class="acronym">GTK+</acronym>. In
            addition, 0.99 used a new form of tile-based memory handling that
            made it possible to load huge images into <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
            (loading a 100 MB image into <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> is no
            problem). Version 0.99 also introduced a new
            native <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> file format called XCF.
          </p>
            <p>
            The new API made it really easy to write extensions and plug-ins
            for <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>. Several new plug-ins and extensions
            emerged to make <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
            even more useful (such as <acronym class="acronym">SANE</acronym>, which enables
            scanning directly into <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>).
          </p>
            <p>
            In the summer of 1997, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> had reached
            version 0.99.10, and S and
            P had to drop most of their support since they had graduated and
            begun jobs. However, the other developers of
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> continued under
            the orchestration of Federico Mena to make
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> ready for prime time.
          </p>
            <p>
            <acronym class="acronym">GTK+</acronym> was separated from
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> in September 1997.
            <acronym class="acronym">GTK+</acronym> had been
            recognized as an excellent toolkit, and other developers began
            using it to build their own applications.
          </p>
            <p>
            <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> went into feature freeze in October
            1997. This meant that no
            new features would be added to the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
            core libraries and program. <acronym class="acronym">GUM</acronym> (GIMP Users
            Manual) version 0.5 was also released early in October 1997.
            The developing work continued to make <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
            stable and ready for version 1.0.
