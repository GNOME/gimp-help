          A whole new default icon theme has been created for 2.4. The icons
          comply with the Tango style guidelines so GIMP doesn't feel out of
          place on any of the supported platforms. Regardless of whether you
          run GIMP under Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux (GNOME, KDE or
          Xfce), GIMP provides a polished, consistent look.

          Unlike previous versions of GIMP, regardless of whether you're using
          a bitmap brush, parametric brush or even a picture tube (multiple
          bitmaps), you can easily set the brush size with either the tool
          options dock slider or an external device such as a MIDI slider or
          knob or a USB device like the Griffin Powermate.

            <p>
          The selection tools have been rewritten from scratch to allow
          resizing of existing selections. Additionally the rectangular
          selection tool includes a setting for creating rounded corners as
          this has been identified as a very common task among web designers.

          The learning curve for the tools has been flattened as the key
          functionality is available without obscure shortcuts that confused
          GIMP beginners. Most of the existing shortcuts still work, but the
          functionality is either available through the tool options or made
          obsolete due to the interactive move and resize on canvas.
        </p>
            <p>
          While the tools have been redesigned to make them easier to
          understand for the newbies, all the former functionality is there.
          You can still constrain aspect ratios or specific sizes.

          Selecting individual objects on images is easier now with a new
          <a class="link" href="gimp-tool-foreground-select.html" title="2.8. Foreground Select">foreground select
          tool</a>. It is done in two steps. First, you make select region
          of interest which contains the entire object. Then you
          paint over selected area with a brush, not crossing object’s border.
          Release mouse button when you’re done and look, if there are dark
          blue spots on your objects. If there are some, paint with a brush
          over them again and release to refine selection. When there are no
          more blue areas inside the object, press Enter and there you have a
          perfectly selected object.

          While GIMP has provided a grid and guideline functionality, the

          Most notable is the new top-level Color menu that accumulates most
          tools, plug-ins and scripts that adjust colors in RGB/Grayscale mode
          and color palettes in Indexed mode. So now you can reach functions
          like Levels or Curves much faster than before, unless you define
          your own keyboard shortcuts for them using the improved keyboard
          shortcuts manager.
        </p>
            <p>
          In the new version of GIMP, some menu entries have changed their
          names and position. It was done mostly to simplify learning curve
          and improve user experience. After all, "HSV Noise" and "RGB Noise"
          sound more meaningful than "Scatter HSV" and "Scatter RGB", don't
          they? And status bar hints for all plug-ins and scripts are quite
          helpful too.

          The fullscreen mode has been improved to not only allow getting a
          full scale preview of the artwork, but also allow comfortable
          editing. The artist has maximum screen estate available while all
          functionality is quickly accessible by pressing the
          <span class="keycap"><strong>Tab</strong></span> key (toggles
          visibility of all docks) when working fullscreen.
        </p>
            <p>
          Whether painting or touching up photos, fullscreen editing keeps all
          the distracting elements out of sight on a key press. It's like
          observing stars in a field as opposed to a light-polluted city.

            <p>
          Just like the selection tools, the new crop tool has been enhanced
          since the last release. The resize handles actually resize the crop
          rectangle instead of providing both resize and move functionality.
          The tool behaves more naturally and consistently with other GIMP
          tools. For details see <a class="xref" href="gimp-tool-crop.html" title="4.4. Crop">Section 4.4, “Crop”</a>.
        </p>
            <p>
          To move, simply drag the rectangle clicking within the area.
          Resizing is possible in one or two axes at the same time dragging
          the handle-bars on the sides and corners. The outside area is
          darkened with a nice passepartout effect to better get the idea of
          how the final crop will look like.

          The healing brush is a new tool, similar in the working of the
          clone tool, that permits to quickly fix small defects or
          imperfections due to scratching or dust. In fact the tool is smart
          enough to being able to <span class="emphasis"><em>understand</em></span> where and
          how to modify an image to cure these defects based on image color
          context.

            <p>
          Here is another clone-like new tool that is able to adapt the
          destination geometry, instead of color as does the healing brush,
          based on preselected distortion settings. As the name suggests,
          perfect when copying images blocks with some type of prospective
          changes.

          A very common problem exposing itself especially when using cheaper
          lenses is barrel distortion and vignetting. Luckily GIMP provides a
