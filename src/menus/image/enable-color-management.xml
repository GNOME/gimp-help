    If unchecked, <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>
    assigns a GIMP built-in sRGB color space to your image.
  </para>

  <para>
    Also, if you've selected to
    display the image's assigned ICC color profile on the title or status bar,
    unchecking Enable Color Management prints
    the phrase "not color managed" to the title or status bar in place
    of the previously assigned color profile.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>Enable Color Management is checked by default. It's best to leave
    this option checked.

<!--    <para>
      If your image is already in one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color spaces,
      unchecking Enable Color Management makes no difference whatsoever in your
      editing results or in the appearance of your image.
    </para>
    <para>
      If your image is not already in one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color
      spaces, then the only time unchecking Enable Color Management won't change
      your image's appearance is if the ICC profile assigned to your image has:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The same channel encoding as the channel encoding that
          GIMP happens to be using at the time you uncheck Enable Color Management.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The same chromaticities as the chromaticities of the
          built-in GIMP sRGB profiles.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      In the above case unchecking Enable Color Management is the
      functional equivalent of assigning the built-in sRGB profile to your image,
      except that simply assigning the built-in sRGB profile to your image
      doesn't produce a misleading status or title bar message that the image is
      "not color managed".

        What does GIMP do when
        <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem> is unchecked?
      </title>
      <para>
        When you uncheck the option to
        <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>, GIMP does
        two things:
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Whatever ICC profile is currently assigned to the image
            file is at least temporarily stored (pending subsequent editing,
            Precision, and Color Management actions), but isn't used.
            And then a built-in GIMP profile is assigned in place of the previously
            assigned ICC profile:
          </para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If the image is at Perceptual gamma (sRGB) precision,
                the ICC profile "GIMP built-in sRGB" is assigned.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                If the image is at Linear light precision, the ICC
                profile "GIMP built-in Linear sRGB" is assigned.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>
            You can confirm that one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color spaces has
            been assigned by checking "Image/Image Properties/Color Profile".
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            If you have set up the title or status bar to show the
        image's color space, then the title or status bar will display a message
        that the image is "not color managed". <emphasis>In reality the image is
        still color managed</emphasis>, but now the image is color managed
        "as if" it were in one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color spaces instead of
        whatever color space it's actually in.
            </para>

      When <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>
      is unchecked, what happens to the image
      and the image appearance?
    </title>
    <note>
      <para>
        Assigning a new profile to an image doesn't change the image's
      actual channel values. Assigning a new ICC profile only changes the meaning
      of the channel values, which means the image appearance will change (unless
      the original and new profile are functionally equivalent).
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      When <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem> is unchecked,
      GIMP assigns one of GIMP's
      built-in sRGB profiles to the image. Assigning a new ICC profile to an image
      doesn't change the image's channel values, but it does more or less
      drastically change the image's appearance:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the image was already in one of GIMP's built-in color
          spaces (or if the assigned ICC profile is a profile that is functionally
          equivalent to the assigned GIMP built-in sRGB profile) then the image's
          appearance will not change.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If the image was not already in one of GIMP's built-in
          color spaces (and is not in a color space that is functionally
          equivalent to the assigned GIMP built-in sRGB profile),
          the image's appearance will change more
          or less drastically depending on three things:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              What GIMP Precision channel encoding &mdash;
              Linear light or Perceptual gamma (sRGB) &mdash; the image was in
              before the <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem> box was unchecked.

    <title>
      Two screenshots showing examples of correct and incorrect image
      appearances after unchecking
      <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>
    </title>
    <para>
      In both screenshots shown below, the image is color
      managed: An ICC profile is assigned to the image, and that profile is being
      used to send the image colors to the screen.
    </para>
    <para>
      But in the second screenshot, after unchecking Enable Color
      Management, one of GIMP's built-in sRGB profiles has been incorrectly
      assigned to the image, so the colors look wrong.
    </para>
    <para>
      In screenshot 1 below, the image is already in a GIMP built-in sRGB
      color space. So unchecking <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>
      makes no difference in the appearance of the image. In this
      particular case unchecking <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem> actually makes
      no difference at all, except that if you've selected to show the
      image's assigned ICC profile in the title or status bar, then instead
      of showing the assigned ICC profile, the title or status bar will
      show the words "not color managed". But in reality the image is still
      color managed:
    </para>
    <mediaobject>

        <imagedata fileref="images/menus/image/color-management/enable-cm-gimp-built-in-perceptual-srgb-color-space-enabled-disabled.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>
      In screenshot 2 below, the channel encoding of the original profile
      matches the GIMP channel encoding (both are linear), but the
      LargeRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc profile chromaticities don't match the GIMP built-in
      sRGB chromaticities. So after unchecking
      <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>, the tonality
      is correct but the colors are wrong. The image is still color managed,
      but it's color managed using the wrong ICC profile:
    </para>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/menus/image/color-management/enable-cm-linear-precision-mismatched-chromaticities.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <caution>
      <para>
        If your image's originally assigned ICC profile doesn't have the same
        channel encoding and chromaticities as the GIMP built-in sRGB profile, and
        you uncheck and then immediately change your mind
        and recheck <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>,
        the originally assigned ICC profile
        will be reassigned to your image and your image channel values will be
        unchanged.
      </para>
      <para>
        Otherwise, whether or not you can recover the originally
        assigned ICC profile and correct colors for your image depends on what
        else you've done between the unchecking and rechecking of
        <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Again, the best possible advice is to <emphasis role="bold">never uncheck <guimenuitem>Enable Color Management</guimenuitem></emphasis>.
      </para>
    </caution>
<!--
    <para>In screenshot 3 below, the chromaticities match, but the channel
    encoding does not match:</para>

    </mediaobject>
    <para>In screenshot 3 above, the sRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc chromaticities
    match the chromaticities of the GIMP built-in linear sRGB profile, but the
    sRGB-elle-V4-srgbtrc.icc profile channel encoding doesn't match the current
    GIMP linear channel encoding. So after unchecking Enable Color
    Management, the colors are correct but the tonality is wrong.</para>
    <para>In screenshot 4 below, both the channel encoding and chromaticities
    are mismatched:</para>

      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>In Screenshot 4 above, the channel encoding of the original
    LargeRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc profile is linear, but GIMP is using the
    Perceptual gamma (sRGB) encoding. Also the LargeRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc
    chromaticities don't match the GIMP built-in sRGB chromaticities.
    So after unchecking Enable Color Management, the tonality is
    wrong (it's too dark) and the colors are wrong.</para>-->
