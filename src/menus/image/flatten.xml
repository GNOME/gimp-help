  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Flatten Image</guimenuitem> command merges all of the
    layers of the image into a single layer with no alpha channel. After
    the image is flattened, it has the same appearance it had before. The
    difference is that all of the image contents are in a single layer
    without transparency. If there are any areas which are transparent
    through all of the layers of the original image, the background color
    is visible.
  </para>
  <para>
    This operation makes significant changes to the structure of the image.
    It is normally only necessary when you would like to save an image in
    a format which does not support levels or transparency (an alpha
    channel).
