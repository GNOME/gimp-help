  <para>
    The <quote>canvas</quote> is the visible area of the image. By default
    the size of the canvas coincides with the size of the layers. The
    <guimenuitem>Canvas Size</guimenuitem> command lets you enlarge or
    reduce the canvas size. You can, if you want, modify the size of the
    layers. When you enlarge the canvas, you create free space around
    the contents of the image. When you reduce it, the visible area is
    cropped, however the layers still extend beyond the canvas border.
  </para>
  <para>
    When you reduce the canvas size, the new canvas appears surrounded with
    a thin negative border in the preview. The mouse pointer is a moving
    cross: click and drag to move the image against this frame.

          <para>
            You can set the <guilabel>Width</guilabel> and the
            <guilabel>Height</guilabel> of the canvas. The default
            units are pixels but you can choose different units, e.g.
            percent, if you want to set the new dimensions relative to the
            current dimensions. If the Chain to the right of the Width and
            Height is not broken, both Width and Height keep the same
            relative size to each other. That is, if you change one of the
            values, the other one also changes a corresponding amount.
            If you break the Chain by clicking on it, you can set
            Width and Height separately.
          </para>
          <para>
            Whatever units you use, information about the size in pixels
            and the current resolution are always displayed below the
            <emphasis>Width</emphasis> and <emphasis>Height</emphasis>
            fields. You cannot change the resolution in the
            <guimenu>Canvas Size</guimenu> dialog; if you want to
            do that, use the <link linkend="gimp-image-print-size">Print

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Offset</guilabel> values are used to place the image
        (the image, not the active layer) on the canvas. You can see the
        size and the content of the canvas in the preview of the dialog
        window. When the canvas is smaller than the image, the preview window
        shows it in a frame with a thin negative border.

            The <guilabel>X</guilabel> and <guilabel>Y</guilabel> specify the
            coordinates of the upper left corner of the image relative to the
            upper left corner of the canvas. They are negative when the
            canvas is smaller than the image. You can place the image in
            different ways (of course, the coordinates can't exceed the
            canvas borders):

                  <keycap>Down</keycap> to change by one pixel (unit), or
                  <keycap>PageUp</keycap> and <keycap>PageDown</keycap> to
                  change the value by 10 pixels (units).

            Before the GIMP-2.4 version, <quote>Canvas Size</quote> had no
            influence on layer size. To change it, you had to use the
            <link linkend="gimp-layer-resize">Layer Boundary Size</link>
            command. The <quote>Layers</quote> option now allows you to
            specify how, possibly, layers will be resized. The drop-down list
            offers you several possibilities:

        When you click on the <guilabel>Resize</guilabel> button,
        the canvas is resized, but the pixel information and the drawing
        scale of the image are unchanged.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the layers of the image did not extend beyond the borders of
        the canvas before you changed its size, there are
        no layers on the part of the canvas that was added by resizing it.
        Therefore, this part of the canvas is transparent and displayed
        with a checkered pattern, and it is not immediately available for
        painting. You can either
        <link linkend="gimp-image-flatten">flatten</link>
        the image, in which case you will get an image with a single layer
        that fits the canvas exactly, or you can use the
        <link linkend="gimp-layer-resize-to-image">Layer to Image Size</link>
        command to resize only the active layer, without changing any other
        layers. You can also create a new layer and fill it with the
        background you want. By doing this, you create a
        digital <quote>passe-partout</quote> (a kind of glass mount
        with a removable back for slipping in a photograph).
