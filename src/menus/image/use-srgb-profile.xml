    assigns a GIMP built-in sRGB color space to your image.

    Also, if you've selected to display the image's assigned ICC color profile
    in the window title (which is the default) or status bar (see
    <link linkend="gimp-prefs-image-window-title">Image Title &amp; Statusbar
    Format</link> preferences), checking <guimenuitem>Use sRGB
    Profile</guimenuitem> will show <quote>GIMP built-in sRGB</quote> in
    the title or status bar in place of the image's assigned color profile.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>For images without color profile, or that have a sRGB profile
    <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem> is disabled and checked by
    default. For images that have a different color profile this option will be
    enabled and unchecked. It's best to leave it that way unless you know what
    you are doing.

    <title>Usage Notes for the Command</title>
    <para>
      The best possible advice is to <emphasis role="bold">never check
      <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem></emphasis> when you are using
      a different color profile.
    </para>

<!--    <para>
      If your image is already in one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color spaces,
      unchecking Enable Color Management makes no difference whatsoever in your
      editing results or in the appearance of your image.
    </para>
    <para>
      If your image is not already in one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color
      spaces, then the only time unchecking Enable Color Management won't change
      your image's appearance is if the ICC profile assigned to your image has:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The same channel encoding as the channel encoding that
          GIMP happens to be using at the time you uncheck Enable Color Management.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The same chromaticities as the chromaticities of the
          built-in GIMP sRGB profiles.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      In the above case unchecking Enable Color Management is the
      functional equivalent of assigning the built-in sRGB profile to your image,
      except that simply assigning the built-in sRGB profile to your image
      doesn't produce a misleading status or title bar message that the image is
      "not color managed".

        What does GIMP do when
        <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem> is checked?
      </title>
      <para>
        When you check the option to
        <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>, GIMP does two things:
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Whatever ICC profile is currently assigned to the image, is stored
            (pending subsequent editing, Encoding, and Color Management
            actions), but isn't used. And then a built-in GIMP sRGB profile is
            assigned in place of the previously assigned ICC profile:
          </para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If the image is in Non-linear encoding,
                the ICC profile "GIMP built-in sRGB" is assigned.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                If the image is in Linear light encoding, the ICC
                profile "GIMP built-in Linear sRGB" is assigned.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>
            You can confirm that one of GIMP's built-in sRGB color spaces has
            been assigned by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Image</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Image Properties</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and checking
            the <guilabel>Color Profile</guilabel>.

      When <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem> is checked, what happens
      to the image and the image appearance?
    </title>
    <note>
      <para>
        Assigning a new profile to an image doesn't change the image's actual
        channel values. Assigning a new ICC profile only changes the meaning
        of these values, which means the image appearance will change
        (unless the original and new profile are functionally equivalent).
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      When <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem> is checked, one of GIMP's
      built-in sRGB profiles is assigned to the image. Assigning a new ICC
      profile to an image doesn't change the image's channel values, but it does
      more or less drastically change the image's appearance:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If the image was already in one of GIMP's built-in color spaces (or if
          the assigned ICC profile is a profile that is functionally equivalent
          to the assigned GIMP built-in sRGB profile) then the image's
          appearance will not change.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If the image was not already in one of GIMP's built-in color spaces
          (and is not in a color space that is functionally equivalent to the
          assigned GIMP built-in sRGB profile), the image's appearance will
          change more or less drastically depending on three things:

      A screenshot showing an example of incorrect image appearance after
      checking <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>
    </title>
    <para>
      The image is color managed: An ICC profile is assigned to the image, and
      that profile is being used to send the image colors to the screen. After
      checking <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>, one of GIMP's
      built-in sRGB profiles has been incorrectly assigned to the image, so the
      colors look wrong.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the screenshot below, the channel encoding of the original profile
      matches the GIMP channel encoding (both are linear), but the
      <quote>LargeRGB-elle-V4-g10.icc</quote> profile chromaticities don't match
      the GIMP built-in sRGB chromaticities. So after checking
      <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>, the tonality is correct but
      the colors are wrong. The image is still color managed, but it's color
      managed using the wrong ICC profile:

    </figure>
    <caution>
      <para>
        If your image's originally assigned ICC profile doesn't have the same
        channel encoding and chromaticities as the GIMP built-in sRGB profile,
        and you check and then immediately change your mind and uncheck
        <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>, the originally assigned
        ICC profile will be reassigned to your image and your image channel
        values will be unchanged.
      </para>
      <para>
        Otherwise, whether or not you can recover the originally assigned ICC
        profile and correct colors for your image depends on what else you've
        done between the checking and unchecking of
        <guimenuitem>Use sRGB Profile</guimenuitem>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Again, the best possible advice is to
