  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Crop Image</guimenuitem> command crops the image to
    the boundary of the selection by removing any strips at the edges whose
    contents are all completely unselected. Areas which are partially
    selected (for example, by feathering) are not cropped. If the selection
    has been feathered, cropping is performed on the external limit of the
    feathered area. If there is no selection for the image, the menu entry is
    disabled and grayed out.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      This command crops all of the image layers. To crop just the active
      layer, use the <link linkend="gimp-layer-crop">Crop Layer</link>
      command.
