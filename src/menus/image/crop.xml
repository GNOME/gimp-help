  <para>
    You can crop image in two ways:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Crop to selection
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Crop to content
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <sect3 id="crop-image-to-selection">
    <title>Crop to selection</title>
    <para>
      The <guimenuitem>Crop to Selection</guimenuitem> command crops the image 
      to the boundary of the selection by removing any strips at the edges 
      whose contents are all completely unselected. Areas which are 
      partially selected (for example, by feathering) are not cropped. If 
      the selection has been feathered, cropping is performed on the 
      external limit of the feathered area. If there is no selection for 
      the image, the menu entry is disabled and grayed out.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        This command crops all of the image layers. To crop the active layer 
        only, use the <link linkend="crop-layer-to-selection">Crop to 
        selection</link> command.
      </para>

  <sect3 id="crop-image-to-content">
    <title>Crop to content</title>
    <para>
      Before GIMP-2.10, this command was named <quote>Autocrop image</quote>. 
      The <guimenuitem>Crop to content</guimenuitem> command removes the
      borders from an image. It searches the active layer for the largest
      possible border area that is all the same color, and then crops this
      area from the image, as if you had used the
      <link linkend="gimp-tool-crop">Crop</link> tool.
    </para>
    <caution>
      <para>
        Note carefully that this command only uses the
        <emphasis>active layer</emphasis> of the image to find borders. 
        Other layers are cropped according to the same limits as limits in 
        the active layer.
      </para>

            This image is made of three layers. One with a red square,
            another with a green square; both on a yellow semi-transparent
            background. The green layer is active.

            <quote>Crop to content</quote> has cropped the green square and 
            made a layer from it. The other layers have been cropped to the 
            same size as the green one. Only a small part of the red square has
            been kept.
