    </menuchoice>,

    "Fill with FG Color" causes the image's selection to be filled
    with the solid color shown in the foreground part of the Color
    Area of the Toolbox. 
    (The color is also shown to the left of the menu entry.)  If
    some areas of the image are only partially selected (for
    example, as a result of feathering the selection), they are
    filled in proportion to their degree of selectedness.
