  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Plug-In Browser</guimenuitem> command displays a
    dialog window which shows all of the extensions (plug-ins) which are
    currently loaded in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, both as a list and
    as a hierarchical tree structure. Since many of the filters are actually
    plug-ins, you will certainly see many familiar names here. Please note
    that you do not run the extensions from this dialog window. Use the
    appropriate menu entry to do that instead. For example, you can run
    filter plug-ins by using the <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem> command
    on the image menubar.
