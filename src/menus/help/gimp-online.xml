    The <guimenuitem>GIMP online</guimenuitem> command displays a submenu
    which provides access to several website links that have to do with various
    aspects of <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. You can click on one

          If you encounter an error or problem when using GIMP, or if you think
          that GIMP could be improved, then you can use this command to open the
          web page of our issue tracker.

          The issue tracker is the best place to let us know about bugs and
          feature requests. Please check first if there is already an existing
          issue that describes your problem. If you open a new issue, please make
          sure to include all relevant information, like your exact GIMP version,
          your Operating System, a screenshot, or a sample image.

      FIXME: While originally "web site" as two words was common, nowadays
      "website" as one word is most common. Eventually we should change this,
      but since we are getting closer to 3.0 let's wait until after that
      release, since this needs string changes in GIMP (gimp-online.scm).
