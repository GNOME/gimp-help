  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Search and Run a Command</guimenuitem> displays a
    dialog where you can search for all commands that are available in GIMP,
    even those that are not part of the menu.
    It is a quick and easy way to start a command if you don't know exactly
    where to find it.

      contain the search phrase you entered.
