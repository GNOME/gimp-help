    "Fill with Pattern" causes the image's selection to be filled
    with the pattern shown in the Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the
    Toolbox.  (The pattern is also shown to the left of the menu
    entry.)  If some areas of the image are only partially selected,
    they are filled in proportion to their degree of selectedness.
