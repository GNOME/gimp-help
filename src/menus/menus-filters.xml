  <para lang='en'>
    In GIMP terminology, a <emphasis>filter</emphasis> is a plug-in
    that modifies the appearance of an image, in most cases just the
    active layer of the image.  Not all of the entries in this menu
    meet that definition, however:  the word "filter" is often abused
    to mean any plug-in regardless of what it does.  Indeed, some of
    the things you will find in this menu do not modify images at
    all. 
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    With the exception of the top three items, all of the entries in
    this menu are provided by plug-ins.  Each plug-in decides for
    itself where it would like its menu entry to be placed.
    Therefore, the appearance of this menu can be completely different
    for each user.  In practice, though, the appearance does not vary
    all that much, because most plug-ins come with GIMP when it is
    installed, and of course they are always in the same places in the
    menu. 
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    Plug-ins are not restricted only to the Filters menu:  a plug-in
    can request to be placed in any menu.  Indeed, a number of GIMP's
    basic functions (for example, "Semi-flatten" in the Layer menu) are
    implemented by plug-ins.  But the Filters menu is the default place
    for a plug-in to locate itself.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    For general information on plug-ins and how to use them, see the
    section on <link linkend='gimp-plugins'>Plugins</link>.
    Information on the filters that are provided with GIMP can be
    found in the <link linkend='filters'>Filters</link> chapter.  For
    filters you install yourself, you will of course have to obtain
    information elsewhere.

  <simplesect id='gimp-filter-repeat'>
    <title lang='en'>Repeat Last</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      This command can be accessed from an image menubar as 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Repeat "<replaceable>filter</replaceable>"</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>,
      or by using the keyboard shortcut
      <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
        <keycap>F</keycap>
      </keycombo>.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>   
      "Repeat Last" repeats the most recently executed plugin, using
      the same settings at the last time it was run.  It does not show
      a dialog or request confirmation.
    </para>

    <note lang='en'>
      It is important to realize that this command repeats the most
      recently executed <emphasis>plugin</emphasis>, regardless of
      whether it can be found in the Filters menu.
    </note>

  <simplesect id='gimp-filter-reshow'>
    <title lang='en'>Re-show Last</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      This command can be accessed from an image menubar as 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Re-show "<replaceable>filter</replaceable>"</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>,
      or by using the keyboard shortcut
      <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
        <keycap>Shift</keycap>
        <keycap>F</keycap>
      </keycombo>.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>   
      "Re-show Last" interactively runs the most recently executed
      plugin. If the plugin is one that uses a dialog window, it does
      so here, with the settings initialized to the values you used
      the last time you ran the plugin.  (Assuming the plugin is
      correctly programmed, that is.)  
    </para>

    <tip lang='en'>
      It is very common, especially for plugins that lack a preview,
      to have to adjust parameters several times before the results
      are satisfactory.  The most efficient way to do this is to
      memorize the keyboard shortcuts for "undo" followed by "re-show
      last":  
      <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
        <keycap>Z</keycap>
      </keycombo>
      followed by
      <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
        <keycap>Shift</keycap>
        <keycap>F</keycap>
      </keycombo>.
    </tip>

  <simplesect>
    <title lang='en'>Reset All Filters</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      This command can be accessed from an image menubar as 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Reset All Filters...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>   
      Normally, each time you run an interactive plugin, the dialog
      comes up with settings initialized to the values you used the
      last time you ran it.  Sometimes this can be very annoying, if
      you mess up the values and don't remember what they were
      originally.  One way to recover is to exit from GIMP and start
      again, but this command provides a slightly less desperate
      solution:  it resets the values for <emphasis>all</emphasis>
      plugins to their defaults.  Because it is a dramatic step, it
      asks you to confirm that you really want to do it.  Be careful:
      this command is not undoable.
