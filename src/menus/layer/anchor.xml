  <para>
    If you have created a floating selection, a temporary layer, called a
    <quote>floating layer</quote> or <quote>floating selection</quote>,
    is added to the layer stack. As long as the floating layer persists,
    you can work only on it. To work on the rest of the
    image, you must <quote>anchor</quote> the floating layer to the former
    active layer with the <guimenuitem>Anchor layer</guimenuitem> command.
    If the image does not contain a floating selection, this menu entry is
    insensitive and grayed out.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      If there is an active selection tool, the mouse pointer is displayed
      with an anchor icon when it is outside of the selection.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          You can anchor the floating selection to the current layer the
          selection is originating by clicking anywhere on the image except on
          the floating selection.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You can also anchor the floating selection to the current layer by
          clicking on the anchor button of the
          <link linkend="gimp-layer-dialog">Layers dialog</link>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you create a <link linkend="gimp-layer-new">New Layer</link>
          while there is a floating selection, the floating selection is
          anchored to this newly created layer.
