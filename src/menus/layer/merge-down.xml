  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem>
    command merges the active layer with the layer just below it in the stack,
    taking into account the various properties of the active layer, such as
    its opacity and layer
    <link linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes">mode</link>.
    The resulting merged layer will be in Normal mode, and will inherit the
    opacity of the layer below. If the layer below is not opaque, or if it is
    in some mode other than Normal, then this command will generally change
    the appearance of the image.
  </para>
  <para>
    The most common use of <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem> is to
    construct a layer, by starting with a <quote>base layer</quote> (usually
    opaque and in Normal mode, so that you can see what you are doing), and
    adding a <quote>modification layer</quote> on top of it, with whatever
    shape, opacity, and layer mode you need.  In this case, merging down the
    modification layer will combine the two layers into one, without
    changing the way the image looks.
