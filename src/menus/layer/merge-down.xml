  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem>
    command merges the active layer with the layer just below it in the stack,
    taking into account the various properties of the active layer, such as
    its opacity and layer
    <link linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes">mode</link>.
    The resulting merged layer will be in Normal mode, have opacity set to 100%,
    and will have an alpha channel even if the original layers didn't have one.
    If the layer below is not opaque, or if it is in some mode other than
    Normal, then this command will generally change the appearance of the image.
  </para>
  <para>
    The most common use of <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem> is to
    construct a layer, by starting with a <quote>base layer</quote> (usually
    opaque and in Normal mode, so that you can see what you are doing), and
    adding a <quote>modification layer</quote> on top of it, with whatever
    shape, opacity, and layer mode you need.  In this case, merging down the
    modification layer will combine the two layers into one, without
    changing the way the image looks.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Merge Down</guimenuitem> command is not available when
    a floating layer is present.
