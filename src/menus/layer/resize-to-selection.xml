    The <guimenuitem>Resize Layers to Selection</guimenuitem> command resizes
    the selected layers to the boundary of the selection by removing any
    strips at the edge whose contents are all completely unselected. Areas
    which are partially selected (for example, by feathering) are not resized.
  </para>
  <para>
    If there is no selection, this menu entry is disabled.
