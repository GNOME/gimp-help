  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Intersect with Selection</guimenuitem> command converts
    the layer mask of the active layer into a selection. The intersection of
    this selection and the selection that is already active form the new
    selection for the image. White areas of the layer mask are selected,
    black areas are not selected, and gray areas are converted into
    feathered selections. The layer mask itself is not modified by this
    command.

            On the left, the original image with a selection. In the middle,
            the Layers Dialog with a layer mask created with the
            <quote>Layer's alpha channel</quote> option. On the right, the
            result after applying <quote>Intersect Mask with Selection</quote>: the
            selection of the non-transparent pixels of the active layer
            is the common part between the initial selection and the mask.
