  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Crop to Selection</guimenuitem> command crops only the
    active layer to the boundary of the selection by removing any strips
    at the edge whose contents are all completely unselected. Areas which
    are partially selected (for example, by feathering) are not cropped.
    If there is no selection for the image, the menu entry is insensitive
    and grayed out.
