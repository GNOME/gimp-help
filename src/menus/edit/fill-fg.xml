    The <guimenuitem>Fill with FG Color</guimenuitem> command fills the
    image's selection with the solid color shown in the foreground part
    of the Color Area of the Toolbox.
    (The color is also shown to the left of the menu entry.)  If
    some areas of the image are only partially selected (for
    example, as a result of feathering the selection), they are
    filled in proportion to how much they are selected.

  <note>
    <para>
      Please note that if the image has no selection, the whole active layer
      is filled.
