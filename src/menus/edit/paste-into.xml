  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Paste Into</guimenuitem> command acts in a similar way
    to the <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> command. The primary difference
    becomes apparent if there is a selection within the canvas. Unlike the
    <quote>Paste</quote> command, which simply centers the pasted image
    data over the selection and replaces the selection with its own,
    <quote>Paste Into</quote> clips the pasted image data by the existing
    selection. The new selection can be moved as usual, but it is always
    clipped by the original selection area.
  </para>
  <para>
    If no selection exists, the <quote>Paste Into</quote> command places
    the data from the Clipboard into the center of the canvas, as the
    <quote>Paste</quote> command does.
