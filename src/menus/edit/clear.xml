  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Clear</guimenuitem> command deletes everything
    in the current selection. If there is no current selection,
    the contents of the active layer are removed. If the active
    layer has an alpha channel, the deleted selection is made
    transparent. You can restore the original color to the transparent
    area using the Eraser tool, by setting it to Anti-Erase. If the
    layer does not have an alpha channel, the deleted area is
    filled using the current background color.
  </para>
  <para>
    Clearing a selection does not delete the selection itself. Unlike
    <quote>Cut</quote>, <quote>Clear</quote> does not place the deleted
    contents in the Clipboard and the contents of the clipboard are
    unaffected.
