  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Paste Into Selection</guimenuitem> command acts in a 
    similar way to the <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> command. The primary 
    difference becomes apparent if there is a selection within the canvas. 
    Unlike the <quote>Paste</quote> command, which simply centers the pasted 
    image data over the selection and replaces the selection with its own,
    <quote>Paste Into Selection</quote> clips the pasted image data by the 
    existing selection. The new selection can be moved as usual, but it is 
    always clipped by the original selection area.
  </para>
  <para>
    If no selection exists, the <quote>Paste Into Selection</quote> command 
    places the data from the Clipboard into the center of the canvas, as the
    <quote>Paste</quote> command does.
