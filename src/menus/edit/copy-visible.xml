  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Copy Visible</guimenuitem> command is similar to the
    <link linkend="gimp-edit-copy">Copy</link> command.  However, it does
    not just copy the contents of the current layer; it copies the contents
    of the visible layers (or the selection of the visible layers), that
    is, the ones that are marked with an <quote>eye</quote>.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      Please note that the information about the layers is lost when the
      image data is put in the clipboard. When you later paste the
      clipboard contents, there is only one layer, which is the fusion of
      all the marked layers.
