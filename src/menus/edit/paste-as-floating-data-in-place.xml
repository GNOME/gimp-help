  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Paste as Floating Data In Place</guimenuitem> command creates a
    floating selection in the active image and pastes the clipboard contents
    into it at the exact location the contents was originally copied from.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the data are not rectangular or square in shape, any regions
    that do not extend to the edge of the canvas are left transparent (an
    Alpha channel is automatically created). Of course, you have to copy your
    selection before you use this command.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      You can have only <emphasis>one</emphasis> floating selection at any
      one time. You cannot work on any other layer while there is a
      floating selection; you have to either anchor it or remove it.
