  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Undo History</guimenuitem> command activates the
    <link linkend="gimp-undo-dialog">Undo History dialog</link>, which
    shows you thumbnails representing the operations you have done
    so far on the current image. This overview makes it easier for
    you to undo steps or to redo them.
  </para>
  <para>
    Use the arrows for
    <link linkend="gimp-edit-undo">Undo</link> and
    <link linkend="gimp-edit-redo">Redo</link>, or simply click
    on the thumbnail, to bring the image back to a previous state.
    This is especially useful when you are working
    on a difficult task, where you often need to undo several steps
    at once. It is much easier to click on step 10 than to type
    <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>
    ten times.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <quote>Clear undo History</quote> command may be useful if you are
    working on a complex image and you want to free some memory.
