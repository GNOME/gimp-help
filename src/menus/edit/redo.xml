  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Redo</guimenuitem> command reverses the effects of
    the <guimenuitem>Undo</guimenuitem> command.  Each
    <quote>Undo</quote> action can be reversed by a single
    <quote>Redo</quote> action. You can alternate <quote>Undo</quote> and
    <quote>Redo</quote> as many times as you like.  Note that you can
    only <quote>Redo</quote> an operation if the last action you did was
    an <quote>Undo</quote>.  If you perform any operation on the image
    after Undoing something, then the former Redo steps are lost, and
    there is no way to recover them.  See the
    <link linkend="gimp-concepts-undo">Undoing</link> section for more
    information.
