  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> command puts whatever is in
    the Clipboard from the last <quote>Copy</quote> or <quote>Cut</quote>
    command into the current image. The pasted section becomes a
    <quote>floating selection</quote> and is shown as a separate layer in the
    Layers Dialog.
  </para>
  <para>
    If there is an existing selection on the canvas, it is used to align
    the pasted data. If there is already a selection, the data is pasted
    using the selection as a center point. If you want the selection to be
    used as a clipping region for the pasted data, you should use
    the <quote>Paste Into</quote> command.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      You can have only <emphasis>one</emphasis> floating selection at any
      one time. You cannot work on any other layer while there is a
      floating selection; you have to either anchor it or remove it.
