  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Paste as Floating Data Into Selection In Place</guimenuitem>
    command replaces the contents of the current selection with the contents of
    the clipboard, at the exact coordinates the contents was originally copied
    from, and turns it into a floating selection.
  </para>
  <para>
    The clipboard data is clipped by the selection, but the image data in it
    can still be moved if it extends outside the selection.
  </para>
  <para>
    If no selection exists, the <quote>Paste as Floating Data Into Selection
    In Place</quote> command places the data from the clipboard into the center
    of the canvas, as the <quote>Paste</quote> command does.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      You can have only <emphasis>one</emphasis> floating selection at any
      one time. You cannot work on any other layer while there is a
      floating selection; you have to either anchor it or remove it.
    </para>
