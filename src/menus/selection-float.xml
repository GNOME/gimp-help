  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Float</guimenuitem> command converts a normal selection
    into a <quote>floating selection</quote>. You can find more information
    about
    <link linkend="glossary-floatingselection">floating selections</link>
    in the Glossary.
  </para>
  <para>
    In early versions of <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, floating
    selections were used for performing operations on a limited part of an
    image. You can do that more easily now with layers, but you can still
    use this way of working with images. In addition to using the
    <guimenuitem>Float</guimenuitem> command, you also automatically create a
    floating selection by click-and-dragging a selection while pressing
    <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo> keys.
  </para>
  <para>
    You cannot perform any operations on other layers if the image has a
    floating selection, so after you make the changes you want to the
    floating selection, you have to <emphasis>anchor</emphasis> it. That is,
    you have to attach it to a normal (non-floating) layer, usually the
    original layer (the one which was active previously). To anchor the
    floating selection, use the
    <link linkend="gimp-layer-anchor">Anchor Layer</link> command. You can
    also anchor it to an existing layer by clicking anywhere on the image
    outside of the floating selection, which then merges it with the
    background layer. You can also anchor it to a new layer by using the
    <link linkend="gimp-layer-new">New Layer</link> command.
  </para>
  <tip>
    <para>
      If you display the layer boundary by using the
      <link linkend="gimp-view-show-layer-boundary">Show Layer Boundary</link>
      command, you may have difficulty selecting a precise area of the
      image which you want in a layer. To avoid this problem, you can make a
      rectangular selection, transform it into a floating selection and
      anchor it to a new layer. Then simply remove the original layer.
