    If this option is enabled, tools will snap to the equidistance between
    three bounding boxes. What this means is, that when you have three layers,
    and you want the same distance between each layer. Move the third layer
    to approximately the same position as the other two layers. If it is close
    enough, it will snap to the correct location and show the amount of pixels
    that are in between on both ends.
    This is useful for accurate placement of image elements.

          This example shows the red layer snapping to the same distance from
          the green layer (19 pixels) as the distance between the green and
          blue layer.
