  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Shrink Wrap</guimenuitem> command resizes the window
    so that it is exactly the same size as the image at the current
    zoom factor. If the image doesn't completely fit on the screen, the
    image window is enlarged so that the largest possible part of the
    image is shown. Please note that <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will
    do this automatically if you set the <quote>Resize window on zoom</quote>
    and <quote>Resize window on image size change</quote> options in the
    <link linkend="gimp-prefs-image-window">Image Window</link> page of
    the Preferences dialog.

      Please note also that the behavior described here is not performed by
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> itself, but by the <quote>window
      manager</quote>, a part of the operating system of your computer.
      For that reason, the functionality described may be different on
      your computer, or in the worst case, might not be available at all.
