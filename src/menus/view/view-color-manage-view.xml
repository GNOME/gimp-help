  <para>
    <guimenuitem>Color-Manage this View</guimenuitem> is enabled by default
    and should usually not be changed. When enabled it will interpret the
    current image according to the color profile attached to it and possibly
    also depending on the monitor profile if set. When
    <link linkend="gimp-view-soft-proof-view">Proof Colors</link> is enabled,
    that will also influence this view.
    Note that you can have several views of the same image with different
    settings to be able to compare the outcome.
    When this setting is disabled, your image will be interpreted as if it
    was sRGB.
