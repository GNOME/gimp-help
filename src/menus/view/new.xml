  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>New View</guimenuitem> command creates a new image
    window for the current image, which you can set up differently from
    the existing display. You can create multiple views of any image, which
    are numbered .1, .2, etc., but only the zoom factor and other viewing
    options may be different. Any changes, other than viewing changes,
    which you make in one window also appear in the other displays which
    show the same image. The new views are not separate image files; they
    are simply different aspects of the same image. You might use multiple
    views, for example, if you were working on individual pixels at a high
    zoom factor. You could then see the effects your changes would have on
    the image at a normal size.
  </para>
  <!-- Deprecated
  <para>
    You can delete a view by closing its window. If you close the last
    window displaying an image, the image itself is closed. However, if
    you have made changes to the image which you have not yet saved, you
    are asked for confirmation.
