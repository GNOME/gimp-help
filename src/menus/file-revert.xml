  <para>
    The <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Revert</guimenuitem> command reloads the image from
    disk, so that it looks just like it did the last time it was saved
    â€” unless, that is, you or some application other than
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> have modified the image file, in
    which case, the new contents are loaded.

  <warning>
    <para>
      When <acronym>GIMP</acronym> reverts a
      file, it actually closes the existing image and creates a new
      image.  Because of this, reverting an image is not undoable, and
      causes the undo history of the image to be lost.
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> tries to protect you from losing your
      work in this way by asking you to confirm that you really want to
      revert the image.
