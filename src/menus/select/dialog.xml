  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Selection Editor</guimenuitem> command displays the
    <quote>Selection Editor</quote> dialog window. This dialog window
    displays the active selection in the current image and gives you easy
    access to the selection-related commands. It is not really intended for
    editing selections directly, but if you are working on a selection, it
    is handy to have the selection commands all together, since it is easier
    to click on a button than to search for commands in the command tree of
    the menubar. The <quote>Selection Editor</quote> also offers some
    advanced options for the <quote>Select to Path</quote> command.

          Amount of error at which it is pointless to reparameterize.
          This happens, for example, when the algorithm is trying to fit the
          outline of the outside of an <quote>O</quote> with a single spline.
          The initial fit is not good enough for the Newton-Raphson
          iteration to improve it.  It may be that it would be better
          to detect the cases where the algorithm didn't find any corners.
