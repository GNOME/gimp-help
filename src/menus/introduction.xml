  <para>
    There are many places in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> where you can
    find menus. The aim of this chapter is to explain all the commands that
    are accessible from the image menu bar and the image menu you can get by
    right clicking in the canvas. All the context menus and the menu entries
    for the other dialogs are described elsewhere in the chapters that
    describe the dialogs themselves.

      This menu bar may contain other entries if you have added script-fus, 
      python-fus or videos to your GIMP.

    <para>
      If you right-click on certain parts of the
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> interface, a
      <quote>context menu</quote> opens, which leads to a variety of
      functions. Some places where you can access context menus are:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Clicking on an image window displays the Image menu. This is useful
          when you are working in full-screen mode, without a menubar.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Clicking on a layer in the Layers Dialog or on a channel in the
          Channels Dialog displays functions for the selected layer or
          channel.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Right-clicking on the image menubar has the same effect as
          left-clicking.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Right-clicking on the title bar displays functions which do not
          belong to <acronym>GIMP</acronym>,
          but to the window manager program on your computer.

    <para>
      There is an interesting property associated with some of the menus in
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>.
      These are any of the menus from the Image context menu you get by
      right-clicking on the canvas and any of its submenus. (You can tell
      that a menu item leads to a submenu because there is an
      <guiicon>
        <inlinegraphic fileref="images/menus/icon-submenu.png" format="PNG"/>
      </guiicon>
      icon next to it.) When you bring up any of these menus, there is a
      dotted line at the top of it (tear-off line). By clicking on this
      dotted line, you detach the menu under it and it becomes a separate
      window.
    </para>

    </figure>

    <para>
      Tear-off menus are actually independent. They are always visible, their
      functions always apply to the current image, and they persist when all
      of the images are closed. You can close a tear-off submenu by clicking
      on the dotted line again or closing the window from the window manager
      on your computer (often by clicking on an X icon in the upper right
      corner of the window).
    </para>
    <para>
      These tear-off submenus are also created in single-window mode, but are 
      of less interest since they are masked by the window as soon as you 
      click on it.

      The following type of menus is not related to the image menu bar, but

      Every <link linkend="gimp-concepts-docks">dockable</link> dialog
      contains a Tab Menu button, as highlighted below. Pressing this Tab
      Menu button opens a special menu of tab-related operations, with an
      entry at the top that opens into the dialog's context menu.
