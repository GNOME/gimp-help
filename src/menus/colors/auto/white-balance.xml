  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>White Balance</guimenuitem> command automatically
    adjusts the colors of the active layer by stretching the Red, Green and
    Blue channels separately. To do this, it discards pixel colors at each
    end of the Red, Green and Blue histograms which are used by only 0.05%
    of the pixels in the image and stretches the remaining range as much as
    possible. The result is that pixel colors which occur very infrequently
    at the outer edges of the histograms (perhaps bits of dust, etc.) do
    not negatively influence the minimum and maximum values used for
    stretching the histograms, in comparison with
    <link linkend="plug-in-c-astretch">Stretch Contrast</link>. Like
    <quote>Stretch Contrast</quote>, however, there may be hue shifts in
    the resulting image.
  </para>
  <para>
    This command suits images with poor white or black. Since it tends to
    create pure white (and black), it may be useful e.g. to enhance
    photographs.
  </para>
  <para>
    <guimenuitem>White Balance</guimenuitem> operates on layers from RGB
    images. If the image is Indexed or Grayscale, the menu item is insensitive
    and grayed out.

            Histogram stretching creates gaps between the pixel columns,
            giving it a striped look.
