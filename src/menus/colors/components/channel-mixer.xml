      with or without an alpha channel. It has monochrome mode and a preview.

            These three sliders set the contribution of red, green or blue
            channel to output. Can be negative. These sliders are graduated
            from -200 to 200. They represent the percentage which will be
            attributed to the output channel. 100% corresponds to the value of
            the channel of the studied pixel in the image.

            This option converts the RGB image into a gray-scale RGB image.
            The Channel Mixer command is often used with this aim in view,
            because it often provides a better result than the other ways
            (see <link linkend="glossary-graylevel">Grayscale</link> in
            Glossary). Makes the <guilabel>Output Channel</guilabel> menu
            insensitive.

              <!--Verified for v2.6-->
              The 21%, 72%, 7% settings give you the same gray luminosity
              (Value) as the Grayscale command in Image/Mode. (They were 30%,
              59%, 11% in v2.2).

          <para>
            Calculations may result in too high values and an image too much
            clear. This option lessens luminosities of the color channels
            while keeping a good visual ratio between them. So, you can change
            the relative weight of the colors without changing the overall
            luminosity.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            In this mode, you have to select an <guilabel>Output Channel
            </guilabel>. This channel is the one which will be modified. In
            the dialog window, its default value is 100%, corresponding to
            the value of the channel in the original image. It can be
            increased or decreased. That's why slider ends are -200 and 200.
          </para>
          <para>
            Three RGB sliders let you give a percentage to every channel. For
            every pixel in the image, the sum of the calculated values for
            every channel from these percentages will be given to the Output
            Channel. Here is an example:

                  RGB values of the pixels in red, green, blue, gray squares
                  are displayed. The black rectangle is special, because black
                  (0;0;0) is not concerned by the command (0 multiplied by any
                  percentage always gives 0). The result can't exceed 255 nor
                  be negative.

                  values are 1;0.5;0. The calculation result is 230*1 + 10*0,5
                  + 10*0 =235. The same reasoning is valid for the green and
                  the blue squares.

                  In the gray square, which contains red color, the
                  calculation result is above 255. It is reduced to 255. A
                  negative value would be reduced to 0.

          <para>
            Here is how the <guilabel>Preserve Luminosity</guilabel>
            works in the monochrome mode:
            <quote>
              For example, suppose the sliders were Red:75%, Green:75%,
              Blue:0%. With <guilabel>Monochrome</guilabel> on and the
              <guilabel>Preserve Luminosity</guilabel>
              option off, the resulting picture would be at 75%+75%+0% =150%,
              very bright indeed. A pixel with a value of, say,
              R,G,B=127,100,80 would map to 127*0.75+100*0.75+80*0=170 for
              each channel. With the Preserve Luminosity option on, the
              sliders will be scaled so they always add up to 100%. In this
              example, that scale value is 1/(75%+75%+0%) or 0.667. So the
              pixel values would be about 113. The Preserve Luminosity option
              just assures that the scale values from the sliders always adds
              up to 100%. Of course, strange things happen when any of the
              sliders have large negative values

            <para><emphasis>Which channel will you modify?</emphasis>
              This depends on what you want to do. In principle, the Red
              channel suits contrast modifications well. The Green channel is
              well adapted to details changes and the Blue channel to noise,
              grain changes. You can use the
              <link linkend="plug-in-decompose-registered">Decompose</link>
              command.
