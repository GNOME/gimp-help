  <para>
    The Threshold filter transforms the current layer or the selection into a
    black and white image, where white pixels represent the pixels of the
    image where the value for the chosen <guilabel>Channel</guilabel> is in the
    threshold range, and black pixels represent pixels with a value outside the
    threshold range.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can use it to enhance a black and white image (scanned text for
    example) or to create selection masks.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      As this filter creates a black and white image, the anti-aliasing of the
      original image disappears. If this poses a problem, use the
      <link linkend="gimp-tool-levels">Levels</link> tool instead.

            single channel:
            <guilabel>Red</guilabel>, <guilabel>Green</guilabel>,
            <guilabel>Blue</guilabel> and <guilabel>Alpha</guilabel> (only
            available when the layer has an alpha channel),

          <para>
            The Threshold tool provides a visual graph, a histogram, of the
            intensity value of the active layer or selection. You can set the
            threshold range either using the minimum and maximum input boxes,
            or by clicking and dragging on the graph. It allows you to select a
            part of the image with some intensity from a background with another
            intensity. Pixels inside the range are white, and the others
            are black. Adjust the range to get the selection you want in
            white on black background.
            The <guibutton>Auto</guibutton> button can be used to automatically
            adjust the threshold.

    <title>Using Threshold and Quick Mask to create a selection mask</title>
    <para>
      That's not always the case, but an element you want to extract from
      an image can stand out well against the background. In this case,
      you can use the Threshold tool to select this element as a whole.
      Grokking the GIMP described a method based on a channel mask, but now,
      using the <link linkend="gimp-image-window-quick-mask-button">Quick mask</link>
      is easier.
    </para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          First start decomposing your image into its RGB and HSV components by
          using the <link linkend="plug-in-decompose">Decompose</link> filter. A
          new grayscale image is created and the components are displayed as
          layers in the Layer dialog. These layers come with a thumbnail but
          it is too small for an easy study. You can, of course, increase the
          size of this preview with the dialog menu (the small triangular
          button), but playing with the <quote>eyes</quote> is more simple to
          display the wanted layer in the decompose image. Select the layer
          that isolates the element the best.

        <para>
          Call the Threshold tool from the decompose image. By moving the
          black cursor, fit threshold to isolate the best the element you want
          to extract. This will probably not be perfect: we will enhance the
          result with the selection mask we are going to create.
        </para>
        <warning>
          <para>
            Make sure you have selected the right layer when you call the
            Threshold tool: when it is opened, you can't change to another
            layer.

        </para>

      <step>
        <para>
          Now, make the original image active. Click the
          <guibutton>Quick Mask</guibutton> button at the bottom-left corner
          of the image window: the image gets covered with a red (default)
          translucent mask. This red color does not suit well to our image
          with much red: go to the Channel Dialog, activate the
          <quote>Quick mask</quote> channel and change this color with the
          <guibutton>Edit Channel Attributes</guibutton>. Come back to the
          original image. Press
          <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>V</keycap></keycombo> to
          paste the previously copied layer.

          Voilà. Your selection mask is ready: you can improve the selection
          as usual. When the selection is ready, disable the Quick mask by
          clicking its button again: you will see the marching ants around
          the selection.
