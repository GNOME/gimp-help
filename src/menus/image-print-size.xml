  <para>
    You can use the <guimenuitem>Print Size</guimenuitem> dialog to change
    the <emphasis>dimensions of a printed image</emphasis> and its
    <emphasis>resolution</emphasis>. This command does not change the number
    of pixels in the image and it does not resample the image. (If you want
    to change the size of an image by resampling it, use the
    <link linkend="gimp-image-scale">Scale Image</link> command.)

    <para>
      The output resolution determines the number of pixels used per unit
      length for the printed image. Do not confuse the output resolution
      with the printer resolution, which is expressed in dpi (dots per
      inch); several dots are used to print a pixel.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the dialog is displayed, the resolution shown in the boxes is the
      resolution of the original image. If you increase the output
      resolution, the printed page will be smaller, since more pixels are
      used per unit of length. Conversely, and for the same reason,
      resizing the image modifies the resolution.
    </para>
    <para>
      Increasing the resolution results in increasing the sharpness of the
      printed page. This is quite different from simply reducing the image
      size by scaling it, since no pixels (and no image information) are
      removed.
    </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            You can set the printing Width and Height by using the
            text boxes. You can also choose the units for these values
            from the dropdown list.
          </para>
          <para>
            As soon as you change the Width or the Height, the X and/or
            Y resolution values automatically change accordingly. If the
            two resolution values remain linked, the relationship of the
            width to the height of the image is also automatically
            maintained. If you would like to set these values independently
            of each other, simply click on the chain symbol to break the
            link.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>X resolution; Y resolution</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            You can set the resolution used to calculate the printed
            width and height from the physical size of the image, that is,
            the number of pixels in it.
          </para>
          <para>
            Use the text boxes to change these resolution values.
            They can be linked to keep their relationship constant. The
            closed chain symbol between the two boxes indicates that the
            values are linked together. If you break the link by clicking
            on the chain symbol, you will be able to set the values
            independently of each other.
