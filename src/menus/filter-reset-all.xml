  <para>
    Normally, each time you run an interactive plug-in, its dialog is
    displayed with all of the settings initialized to the ones you used
    the last time you ran it. This may be a problem if you made a mistake
    setting the values and you can't remember what they were originally.
    One way to recover is to exit <acronym>GIMP</acronym> and
    start again, but the <guimenuitem>Reset all Filters</guimenuitem>
    command is a slightly less drastic solution: it resets the values for
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> plug-ins to their defaults. Because it is a
    dramatic step, it asks you to confirm that you really want to do it.
    Be careful: you cannot undo this command.
