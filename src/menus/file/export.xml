  <para>
    When the opened image is a native XCF file this command is called
    <quote>Export</quote>. In that case, it does the same thing as
    <command>Export As…</command>.
  </para>
  <anchor id="gimp-file-overwrite"/>
  <para>
    When the opened image was imported, this command is called
    <quote>Overwrite filename.extension</quote>. Using this command, you can
    export the imported image directly in its original file format, without
    going through the export dialog.
