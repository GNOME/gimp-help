  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> command causes
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> to close all images and exit. If there
    are any open images which contain unsaved changes (that is, they are
    not marked as <quote>clean</quote>),
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> notifies you and displays a list of
    the unsaved images. You can then choose which images you would
    like to save, or you can cancel the command. Note
    that if you have a large number of images open, or are using a
    large part of the RAM on your system, it may take a little
    while for everything to shut down.

          For most systems on which the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> runs,
          you can also execute it by clicking on a
          <quote>Close</quote> button somewhere on the main image window's
          titlebar.  The location and appearance of this button are
          determined by the windowing system and the window manager.
          Clicking on this button closes GIMP when no image is open.
