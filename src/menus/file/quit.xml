  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> command causes
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> to close all images and exit. If there
    are any open images which contain unsaved changes (that is, they are
    not marked as <quote>clean</quote>),
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> notifies you and displays a list of
    the unsaved images. You can then choose which images you would
    like to save, or you can cancel the command. Note
    that if you have a large number of images open, or are using a
    large part of the RAM on your system, it may take a little
    while for everything to shut down.

          You can access this command from the main menu through
          <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem>

          or by using the keyboard shortcut

          For most systems on which <acronym>GIMP</acronym> runs,
          you can also execute it by clicking the <quote>Close</quote> button
          on the main window titlebar in single-window mode. In multi-window
          mode, this closes the image, unless no image is open.

        <para>
          The location and appearance of this button vary from system to system.
          Activating this button will close <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. If there
          are open images with unsaved changes you will be asked whether you
          want to quit, possibly losing changes, or go back to working in
          <acronym>GIMP</acronym> so you can save the images.
