  <para>
    This command is called <quote>Export</quote> for a native XCF file.
    Then, it does the same thing as <command>Export As</command>.
    At early <application><acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.8</application> releases,
    this menu label was <quote>Export to</quote>.  Since the version 2.8.10,
    <quote>Export to</quote> and <quote>Export</quote> have been renamed to
    <quote>Export</quote> and <quote>Export As</quote> after the manner of
    <quote>Save</quote> and <quote>Save As</quote>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The name becomes <quote>Overwriting name.extension</quote> for an imported
    image. So, you can export the imported image directly in its original
    file format, without going through the export dialog.
  </para>
