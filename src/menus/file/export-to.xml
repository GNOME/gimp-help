  <para>
    This command is called <quote>Export to</quote> for a native XCF file.
    Then, it does the same thing as <command>Export</command>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The name becomes <quote>Overwriting name.extension</quote> for an imported
    image. So, you can export the imported image directly in its original
    file format, without going through the export dialog.
  </para>
