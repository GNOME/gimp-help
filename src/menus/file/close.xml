  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Close</guimenuitem> command closes the active image. If
    the image is not in the main window, then the window is closed also. If
    the image is in the main window, the image is closed but the window
    remains, empty.

  <para>
    Closing an image is not undoable: once it is
    closed, everything is gone, including the undo history.  If the image
    is not <quote>clean</quote> — that is, if you have changed it since the
    last time you saved it — you are asked to confirm that you really want
    to close it.  Note that an image is marked as clean when it is saved to
    a file, even if the file format chosen does not preserve all the
    information in the image, so it is a good idea to think for a moment
    about what you are doing before closing an image.  If there is the
    slightest possibility that you will regret it, it can't hurt to save a
    copy as an <link linkend="glossary-xcf">XCF</link> file.

          For most systems on which the <acronym>GIMP</acronym> runs,
          you can also execute it by clicking on a
          <quote>Close</quote> button somewhere on the image window titlebar.
          The location and appearance of this button are determined by the
          windowing system and the window manager.
        </para>
        <note>
          <para>
            If you close the image window, as described above,
            <acronym>GIMP</acronym> simply closes your image.
            However, if you close the Toolbox window by using the
            <quote>Close</quote> button, <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
            itself exits.
