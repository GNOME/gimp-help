  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Close View</guimenuitem> command closes the active image.
    It is disabled if no image is open.
  </para>
  <para>
    Closing an image is not undoable: once it is closed, everything is gone,
    including the undo history. If the image is not <quote>clean</quote> — that
    is, if you have changed it since the last time you saved it — you are asked
    to confirm that you really want to close it.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      An image is only marked as clean when it is saved as an XCF file.
      Exporting to a different image format does not mark a changed image as
      clean, since it does not preserve all the information in the image.

          You can access this command from the main menu through

            <guimenu>File</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Close View</guimenuitem>

        <para>
          In single-window mode, you can also execute it by clicking the
          <quote>Close</quote> button on the image bar.
          In multi-window mode, you click the <quote>Close</quote> button on
          the image window.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the image has unsaved changes you will be asked whether you
          want to close it, possibly losing changes, or go back to working in
          <acronym>GIMP</acronym> so you can save the image.
