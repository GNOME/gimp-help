  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Close</guimenuitem> command closes the active image.It is
    disabled if no image is open.
  </para>
  <para>
    Closing an image is not undoable: once it is closed, everything is gone,
    including the undo history. If the image is not <quote>clean</quote> — that
    is, if you have changed it since the last time you saved it — you are asked
    to confirm that you really want to close it.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      An image is only marked as clean when it is saved as an XCF file.
      Exporting to a different image format does not mark a changed image as
      clean, since it does not preserve all the information in the image.

          For most systems on which <acronym>GIMP</acronym> runs,
          you can also execute it by clicking on a
          <quote>Close</quote> button somewhere on the image window titlebar.
          The location and appearance of this button are determined by the
          windowing system and the window manager. If no image is open,
          clicking on this button closes GIMP.
