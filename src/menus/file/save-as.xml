    The <guimenuitem>Save as</guimenuitem> command displays the <quote>Save
    Image</quote> dialog. Since <acronym>GIMP</acronym>-2.8, the
    file is automatically saved in the XCF format and you can't
    <emphasis>save</emphasis> in another file format (for this, you have to
    <emphasis>export</emphasis> the file). The Save as dialog allows you to
    save with another name and/or to another folder.
