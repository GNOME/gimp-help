  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Save as</guimenuitem> command
    displays the <quote>Save Image</quote> dialog.
    In its basic form, as shown below, this gives you a text box
    to assign a name to the file, and a drop-down list of bookmarks
    to select a directory to save it in.  Normally the file
    format is determined by the extension you use in the file name
    (i.e., .jpg for a JPEG file).  You can use the <guilabel>Select File
    Type</guilabel> option expander to pick a different file type, but you
    should avoid doing this unless absolutely necessary, to avoid
    confusion.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the directory you want is not in the list of bookmarks, click on
    <guilabel>Browse for other folders</guilabel>
    to expand the dialog to its full form. You can find an explanation of
    the layout, and help on creating and using bookmarks, in the
    <link linkend="gimp-using-fileformats">Files</link>
    section.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you saved the image previously and don't need to change the file name
    or any of the options, you can use the
    <link linkend="gimp-file-save">Save</link> command instead.

    <title>The basic <quote>Save Image</quote> dialog</title>
    <para>
      There are two different forms of the <guimenu>Save Image</guimenu>
      dialog. The simple form only lets you type in the filename and
      choose the directory the file should be saved in. If the folder
      you want is not on the list, you can type in the path to the
      directory, along with the filename. You can also click on the small
      triangle to display the full folder browser. You can also choose
      the image format, by selecting the file extension (e.g.,
      <filename class="extension">.xcf</filename> or
      <filename class="extension">.png</filename>).

          The left panel is divided into two parts. The upper part lists
          your main directories and your storage devices; you cannot modify
          this list. The lower part lists your bookmarks; you can add or
          remove <emphasis>bookmarks</emphasis>. To add a
          bookmark, select a directory or a file in the middle panel
          and click on the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button at the bottom
          of the left
          panel. You can also use the <guilabel>Add to bookmarks</guilabel>
          command in the context menu, which you get by clicking the
          right mouse button. You can delete a bookmark by selecting
          it and clicking on the <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button.
        </para>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The middle panel displays a list of the files in the current
          directory. Change your current directory by double left-clicking on
          a directory in this panel. Select a file with a single left click.
          You can then save to the file you have selected by clicking on the
          <guibutton>Save</guibutton>
          button. Note that a double left click saves the file directly.
        </para>

          resolution and the image's composition are displayed below
          the preview window.

            is overwritten.

          This drop-down list is only available in the basic form of the
          dialog. It provides a list of bookmarks for selecting a directory
          in which to save your file.

          This button shows <guilabel>All Images</guilabel> by default. This
          means that all images will be displayed in the middle panel,
          whatever their file type. By developing this list, you can choose
          to show only one type of file.

          At <guilabel>Select File Type</guilabel>, you have to select
          the file format for saving the file. If you select
          <guilabel>By Extension</guilabel>, the file type is determined
          by the extension you add to the name, for example,
          <quote>.jpg</quote> for JPEG format.

          <para>
            To preserve all the components of your image when you
            save it — the layers, channels, etc. — use ".xcf" format,
            which is the <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s native
            format.
