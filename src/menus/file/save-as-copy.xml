  <para>
    The <guimenuitem>Save a Copy</guimenuitem> command does the same thing
    as the <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem> command, but with one important
    difference. It always asks for a file name and saves the image into the
    specified file, but it does not change the name of the active image
    or mark it as <quote>clean</quote>. As a result, if you try to delete
    the image, or exit from <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you are
    informed that the image is <quote>dirty</quote> and given an opportunity
    to save it.
  </para>
  <para>
    This command is useful when you want to save a copy of your image in
    its current state, but continue to work with the original file without
    interruption.
