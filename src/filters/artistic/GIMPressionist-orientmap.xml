    <para>
      The Orientation-map editor is an annexe of the
      <link linkend="plug-in-gimpressionist">GIMPressionist</link> filter. You
      can get to it by clicking on the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button
      in the <quote>Orientation</quote> tab. With this editor, you can set
      the direction that brush strokes given by filter will have.

      <para>
        You can place one or several vectors. You can set their direction and
        their strength. They will act on the corresponding area of the image.

          <para>
            In the left windows (Vectors) you can manage your vectors. By
            default, a vector is at center. Vectors are red when they are
            active, and grey when they are not with a white point at tip.

                By clicking on the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button, you add
                a vector at center of the window, whereas clicking with the
                mouse <mousebutton>Middle&nbsp;Button</mousebutton> puts it
                where you click.

              With the scroll bar on the right of the Vectors panel, you can
              set the image brightness. This can be very useful if the image
              is very dark/bright and you can't see vectors well.

            This Preview gives you an idea of the action of the various
            vectors. The slider on the right border lets you change the
            luminosity of this preview.

          <para>
            You have there some types to arrange the brush strokes within the
            selected vector domain. Describing them is difficult, but you can
            see the result in the Preview.

          <para>
            A Voronoi's diagram consists in
            partitioning a plane with n master points into n polygons
            where each polygon has only one of these n master points and
            where any given other point of the polygon is closer to the
            master point than to any other. So each polygon limit is
            midway between two master point. Here is an example of a
            Voronoi's diagram:
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata format="PNG"
                  fileref="images/filters/examples/voronoi.png"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            Here, when this option is checked, only the vector closest to
            a given point of the image influences this point.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Direction of the selected vector.
            This slider has the same action as right-clicking (see above).
          </para>

        <term>Angle Offset</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This slider allows you to change the angle of ALL vectors.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Strength</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This slider acts on the influence domain of the selected vector.
            This influence lowers with distance. Strength is showed with the
            vector length.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            This slider acts on the length of ALL vectors, and so changes
            the strength of all brush strokes.
