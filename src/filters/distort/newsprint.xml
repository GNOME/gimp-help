    <para>
      This filter halftones the image using a clustered-dot dither. Halftoning
      is the process of rendering an image with multiple levels of grey or
      colour (i.e. a continuous tone image) on a device with fewer tones;
      often a bi-level device such as a printer or typesetter.
    </para>
    <para>
      The basic premise is to trade off resolution for greater apparent tone
      depth (this is known as spatial dithering).
    </para>
    <para>
      There are many approaches to this, the simplest of which is to throw
      away the low-order bits of tone information; this is what the posterize
      filter does. Unfortunately, the results don't look too good. However, no
      spatial resolution is lost.
    </para>
    <para>
      This filter uses a clustered-dot ordered dither, which reduces the
      resolution of the image by converting cells into spots which grow or
      shrink according to the intensity that cell needs to represent.
    </para>
    <para>
      Imagine a grid super-imposed on the original image.  The image is
      divided into cells by the grid - each cell will ultimately hold a single
      spot made up of multiple output pixels in order to approximate the
      darkness of the original image in that cell.
    </para>
    <para>
      Obviously, a large cell size results in a heavy loss in resolution! The
      spots in the cells typically start off as circles, and grow to be
      diamond shaped. This change in shape is controlled by a <guilabel>spot
      function</guilabel>. By using different spot functions, the evolution
      in the shape of the spots as the cell goes from fully black to fully
      white may be controlled.

                  colorspace conversion is performed. In
                  <emphasis>CMYK</emphasis>, the image is first
                  internally converted to CMYK, then each colour channel is
                  separately halftoned, before finally being
                  recombined back to an RGB image.
                  In <emphasis>Intensity</emphasis> mode, the
                  image is internally converted to grayscale,
                  halftoned, then the result used as the alpha channel
                  for the input image.  This is good for special
                  effects, but requires a little experimentation to
                  achieve best results.  Hint: try CMYK if you don't know
                  which to go for initially.

          <para>
            Proper halftoning does not need antialiasing: the aim is to
            reduce the colour depth after all!  However, since this
            plugin is mainly for special effects, the results are
            displayed on screen rather than by a black/white printer.
            So it is often useful to apply a little anti-aliasing to
            simulate ink smearing on paper.  If you do want to print the
            resulting image then set the antialising to 1 (ie, off).
