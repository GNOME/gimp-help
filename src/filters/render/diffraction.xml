      This filter lets you make diffraction or wave interference textures.
      You can change the Frequency, Contours and Sharp Edges for each of the
      RGB  channels. You can also set Brightness, Scattering and Polarization
      of the texture. There is no automatic preview, so you must press the
      preview button to update. On a slow system, this may take a bit of
      time. Note that result doesn't depend on the initial image.

      This is a very useful filter if you want to create intricate patterns.
      It's perfect for making psychedelic, batik-like textures, or for
      imitating patterns in stained glass (as in a church window).

      It seems clear that the plugin works by simulating the physics of light
      striking a grating. Unfortunately, the original authors never got around
      to writing down the theory behind it, or explaining what the parameters
      mean. The best approach, then, is just to twiddle things and see what
      happens. Fortunately, almost anything you do seems to produce
      interesting results.
