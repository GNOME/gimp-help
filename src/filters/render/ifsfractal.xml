    <para>
      This fractal-based plug-in is truly wonderful! With this
      versatile instrument, you can create amazingly naturalistic
      organic shapes, like leaves, flowers, branches, or even whole
      trees.  (<quote>IFS</quote> stands for <quote>Iterated Function System
      </quote>.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The key to use this plug-in lies in making very small and precise
      movements in fractal space. The outcome is always hard to predict, and
      you have to be extremely gentle when you change the pattern. If you make
      a component triangle too big, or if you move it too far (even ever so
      slightly), the preview screen will black out, or more commonly, you'll
      get stuck with a big shapeless particle cloud.
    </para>
    <para>
      A word of advice: When you have found a pattern you want to work with,
      make only small changes, and stick to variations of that pattern. It's
      all too easy to lose a good thing. Contrary to what you might believe,
      it's really much easier to create a leaf or a tree with IFS Compose than
      to make a defined geometrical pattern (where you actually know what
      you're doing, and end up with the pattern you had in mind).

            The plug-in interface consists of the compose area to the left, a
            preview screen to the right, and some tabs and option buttons at
            the bottom of the dialog. The Default setting (in the preview
            window) is three equilateral triangles. (This gives rise to a
            fractal pattern called the
            <emphasis>Sierpinski Triangle</emphasis>).

                        for obvious reasons a waste of process time unless
                        your image is very large.)

                        radius produces thick, solid color strokes much like
                        watercolor painting. Be careful not to use too much
                        spot radius -- it takes a lot of time to render.

                  When you have many fractals with different colors, the
                  colors blend into each other. So even if you set
                  <quote>pure red</quote> for a fractal, it might actually
                  be quite blue in some places, while another <quote>red
                  </quote> fractal might have a lot of yellow in it. Scale
                  Hue/Value changes the color strength of the active
                  fractal, or how influential that fractal color should be.

      This is a rather complex plug-in, so to help you understand it, we'll

    <para>
      Many forms of life, and especially plants, are built like
      mathematical fractals, i.e., a shape that reproduces or repeats
      itself indefinitely into the smallest detail. You can easily
      reproduce the shape of a leaf or a branch by using four (or
      more) fractals. Three fractals make up the tip and sides of the
      leaf, and the fourth represents the stem.

          Open IFS Compose. Start by rotating the right and bottom triangles,

          what's going to be the tip and sides of the leaf. (If you have

          are not equivalent.)
