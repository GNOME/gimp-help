  <para>
    Most <acronym>GIMP</acronym> filters work on a layer by transforming its
    content, but the filters in the <quote>Render</quote> group are a bit
    different. They create patterns from scratch, in most cases obliterating
    anything that was previously in the layer. Some create random or noisy
    patterns, others regular of fractal patterns, and one (Gfig) is a
    general-purpose (but rather limited) vector graphics tool.
