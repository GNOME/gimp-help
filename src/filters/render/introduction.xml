  <para>
    Most GIMP filters work on a layer by transforming its content, but
    the filters in the <quote>Render</quote> group are a bit different.
    They create patterns from scratch, in most cases obliterating anything
    that was previously in the layer.  Some create random or noisy
    patterns, others regular of fractal patterns, and one (Gfig) is a
    general-purpose (but rather limited) vector graphics tool.
