  <para>
    Map filters use an object named <emphasis>map</emphasis> to modify an
    image: you map the image to the object. So, you can create 3D effects
    by mapping your image to another previously embossed image ("Bumpmap"
    Filter) or to a sphere ("Map Object" filter). You can also map a part
    of the image elsewhere into the same image ("Illusion" and "Make
    Seamless" filters), bend a text along a curve ("Displace" filter)...
