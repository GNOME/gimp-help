  <para>
    Edge detect filters search for borders between different colors
    and so can detect contours of objects.

    They are used to make selections and for many artistic purposes.

  <para>
    Most of them are based on gradient calculation methods and give thick
    border lines. Look at fig.1 which represents color intensity
    variations. On the left is a slow color gradient which is not a border.
    On the right is a quick variation which is an edge. Now, let us
    calculate the gradient, the variation speed, of this edge, i.e the first
    derivative (fig.2). We have to decide that a border is detected when
    gradient is more than a threshold value (the exact border is at top of
    the curve, but this top varies according to borders). In most cases,
    threshold is under top and border is thick.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Laplacian edge detection uses the second derivative (fig.3).
    The top of the curve is now at zero and clearly identified. That's
    why Laplace filter renders a thin border, only a pixel wide. But
    this derivative gives several zeros corresponding to small
    ripples, resulting in false edges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Some blurring before applying edge filters is often necessary: it
    flattens small ripples in signal and so prevents false edges.
