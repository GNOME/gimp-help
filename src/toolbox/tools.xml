  <para lang="en">
    The GIMP has a diverse assortment of tools that let you perform a
    large variety of tasks.  The tools can be thought of as falling
    into five categories: <emphasis>Selection tools</emphasis>, which
    specify or modify the portion of the image that will be affected
    by subsequent actions; <emphasis>Paint tools</emphasis>, which
    alter the colors in some part of the image; <emphasis>Transform
    tools</emphasis>, which alter the geometry of the image;
    <emphasis>Color tools</emphasis>, which alter the distribution of
    colors across the entire image; and <emphasis>Other
    tools</emphasis>, which don't fall into the other four categories.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    (In case you're curious, in Gimp lingo a "tool" is a way of
    acting on an image that requires access to its display, either
    to let you indicate what you want to do by moving the pointer
    around inside the display, or to show you interactively the
    results of changes that you have made.  But if you want to think
    of a tool as a saw, and an image as a piece of wood, it probably
    won't do you a great deal of harm.)
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    Most tools can be activated by clicking on an icon in the Toolbox.
    Some, however (namely, the Color tools), are accessible only via
    the menus, either as <emphasis>Tools->Color Tools</emphasis> or as
    <emphasis>Layer->Colors</emphasis>. Every tool, in fact, can be
    activated from the <emphasis>Tools</emphasis> menu; also, every
    tool can be activated from the keyboard using an accelerator key.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    In the default setup, created when GIMP is first installed, not
    all tools show icons in the Toolbox: the Color tools are omitted.
    You can customize the set of tools that are shown in the Toolbox
    using the <link linkend='gimp-tools-dialog'>Tools dialog</link>.
    There are two reasons you might want to 
    do this:  first, if you only rarely use a tool, it might be easier
    to find the tools you want if the distracting icon is removed;
    second, if you use the Color tools a lot, you might find it
    convenient to have icons for them easily available.  In any case,
    regardless of the Toolbox, you can always access any tool at any
    time using the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu from an image
    menubar.
  </para>
    
  <para lang='en'>
    If you have things set up like most people do, activating a tool
    causes its Tool Options dialog to appear below the
    Toolbox.   If you don't have things set up this way, you
    probably should:  it is very difficult to use tools effectively
    without being able to manipulate their options.  
  </para>

  <tip lang='en'>
    The Tool Options appear beneath the Toolbox in the default
    setup.  If you lose it somehow, you can get it back by creating
    a new Tool Options dialog using <emphasis>File->Dialogs->Tool
    Options</emphasis>, and then docking it below the Toolbox.  See
    the section on <link linkend='gimp-docks'>Dialogs and Docking</link> if
    you need help.
  </tip> 

  <para lang='en'>
    Each tool has its own specific set of options.  The choices you make
    for them are kept throughout the session, until you change them.  In
    fact, by default the tool options are even maintained from session
    to session.  (You can alter this in the Session part of the <link
    linkend='gimp-prefs-dialog'>Preferences</link> dialog, though.) The
    persistence of tool options across sessions can sometimes be an
    annoying nuisance:  a tool behaves very strangely, and you can't
    figure out why until you remember that you were using some
    unusual option the last time you worked with it, two weeks ago.

    The shape of the cursor changes when it is inside an image,
    to one that indicates which tool is active.
