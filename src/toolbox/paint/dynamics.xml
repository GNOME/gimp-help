  <para>
    The dynamics apply a more <quote>real feeling</quote> to the brush by
    connecting one or more of the brush parameters to the way of using the
    brush. You may for instance let the width of the pencil vary according to
    the speed of the stylus or the mouse, make the color saturation
    depending on the stylus pressure, make the color changing as the
    direction of the brush changes on the canvas, and so on. You may choose
    among several presets or define your own. The dynamics are created to be
    used together with drawing tablets, but some are available using the mouse.
  </para>
  <para>
    The dynamics will make some of the behaviors of the drawing tools act more
    like the physical (<quote>real</quote>) tools.

            the width of the brush will vary while the height of the brush
            is constant. If the slider is set to a positive value only the

      The examples shown are very brief, but will perhaps give you an idea
      of how to use this functions. Feel free to try other combinations. In
      these examples the foreground color is set to blue (#0000ff) and the
      background color to yellow (#ffff00). Fading: 200 pixels. Paintbrush
      size: 72. All other settings are the default values except for those

          Example 1 shows the result when the brush size is connected to the
          fading. Default options. The brush size starts as zero and increase
          to the size set in the brush size slider in the Tools Options Dialog.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          In example 2 the brush size is still connected to the fade tool,
          but the fade curve is set as in image 5. The brush size starts at
          zero, fades up to full size and then fades down to zero again.
        </para>
        <para>
          The full fade length is set along the x-axis from left to right. The
          y-axis determines the size of the brush. At the bottom the brush size
          is zero, and at the top of the diagram the brush is set to the full
          size according to the size set in the slider in the Brush Options
          Dialog. Study the example and the curve to see the relationship.

          In example 3 the brush size is disconnected from the fade tool. The
          color is connected with the fade option with the curve set as in
          image 6. At the start of the drawing the color is picked from the
          left side of the gradient, then gradually more from the right side
          of the gradient and then finally fading back to the left side again.
        </para>
        <para>
          As usual the x-axis is the total fade length. When the curve is
          near the bottom of the diagram the color is picked from the left
          side of the gradient. With the curve at the top of the diagram
          the color is picked from the right side of the gradient.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The last example shows a combination of these two settings. Both
          the size of the brush and the color are connected to the fading
          function with the curves set as in image 5 and 6.

      Many of the dynamics behaviors also depends on the settings of the
      Dynamics Options in the Tool Options dialog and vice versa. For example
      the fading will not work if it is not applied in the Dynamics section.

            This slider determines the length of the fading. What will
            actually happen depends on the setting of the Dynamic. If
            set to act on the color for example, the color will be taken from
            the current gradient starting from the left side of the gradient
            and moving toward the right side of the gradient.
