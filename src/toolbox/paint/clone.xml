  <para>
    The Clone tool uses the current brush to copy from an image or pattern.
    It has many uses: one of the most important is to repair problem areas in
    digital photos, by <quote>painting over</quote> them with pixel data from 
    other areas. This technique takes a while to learn, but in the hands of a 
		skilled user it is very powerful. Another important use is to draw 
		patterned lines or curves: see 
		<link linkend="gimp-concepts-patterns">Patterns</link> for examples.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you want to clone from an image, instead of a pattern, you must tell
    GIMP which image you want to copy from. You do this by holding down the
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key and clicking in the desired source image.
    Until you have set the source in this way, you will not be able to paint
    with the Clone tool: the tool cursor tells you this by showing
    <guiicon>
      <inlinegraphic fileref="images/toolbox/clone-bad.png"/>
    </guiicon>.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you clone from a pattern, the pattern is <emphasis>tiled</emphasis>;
    that is, when the point you are copying from moves past one of the
    edges, it jumps to the opposite edge and continues, as though the pattern
    were repeated side-by-side, indefinitely. When you clone from an image
    this does not happen: if you go beyond the edges of the source, the Clone
    tool stops producing any changes.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can clone from any drawable (that is, any layer, layer mask, or
    channel) to any other drawable. You can even clone to or from the
    selection mask, by switching to QuickMask mode. If this means copying
    colors that the target does not support (for example, cloning from an RGB
    layer to an Indexed layer or a layer mask), then the colors will be
    converted to the closest possible approximations.

            The <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key is used to select the source, if
            you are cloning from an image: it has no effect if you are
            cloning from a pattern. You can clone from any layer of any
            image, by clicking on the image display, with the
            <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key held down, while the layer is active
            (as shown in the Layers dialog). If Alignment is set to
            <guilabel>None</guilabel>, <guilabel>Aligned</guilabel>, or
            <keycap>Fixed</keycap> in tool options, then the point you
            click on becomes the origin for cloning: the image data at that
            point will be used when you first begin painting with the Clone
            tool. In source-selection mode, the cursor changes to a reticle
            cross symbol
            <guiicon>

                  In this mode, each brushstroke is treated separately. For
                  each stroke, the point where you first click is copied from
                  the source origin; there is no relationship between one
                  brush stroke and another. In non-aligned mode, different
                  brush strokes will usually clash if they intersect each
                  other.

                  In this mode, the first click you make when painting sets
                  the offset between the source origin and the cloned result,
                  and all subsequent brushstrokes use the same offset. Thus,
                  you can use as many brushstrokes as you like, and they will
                  all mesh smoothly with one another.
                </para>
                <para>
                  If you want to change the offset, select a new source origin
                  by clicking with the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key pressed.
                </para>
                <para>
                  In the example below, at every new brush stroke, the source
                  keeps the same offset it had with the previous brush stroke.
                  So, there is no cloning offset for the first brush stroke.
                  Here, for the following strokes, the source ends up out of
                  the source image canvas; hence the truncated aspect.

                  The <quote>Registered</quote> mode is different from the
                  other alignment modes. When you copy from an image, a
                  <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-click will register a source layer.
                  Then painting in a target layer will clone each
                  corresponding pixel (pixel with the same offset) from the
                  source layer. This is useful when you want to clone parts
                  of an image from one layer to another layer within the same
                  image. (But remember that you can also clone from one image
                  to another image.)

                  At every brush stroke, the source adopts the position of the
                  mouse pointer in the destination layer. In the following
                  example, the destination layer is smaller than the source
                  layer; so, there is no truncated aspect.

            from a transparent source, nothing happens to the target. If you
            clone from a partially transparent source, the effect is weighted
            by the opacity of the source. So, assuming 100% opacity and a hard
            brush:

            Cloning can never increase transparency, but, unless <quote>keep
            transparency</quote> is turned on for the layer, it can reduce
            it.
            Cloning an opaque area onto a translucent area produces an opaque
            result; cloning a translucent area onto another translucent area
            causes an increase in opacity.

            There are a few non-obvious ways to use the Clone tool to obtain
            powerful effects. One thing you can do is to create <quote>Filter
            brushes</quote>, that is, create the effect of applying a filter
            with a brush. To do this, duplicate the layer you want to work
            on, and apply the filter to the copy. Then activate the Clone
            tool, setting Source to <quote>Image source</quote> and Alignment
            to <quote>Registered</quote>. <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-click on the
            filtered layer to set it as the source, and paint on the original
            layer: you will then in effect be painting the filtered image
            data onto the original layer.

            You can use a similar approach to imitate Photoshop's
            <quote>History brush</quote>, which allows you to selectively
            undo or redo changes using a brush. To do this, start by
            duplicating the image; then, in the original, go back to the
            desired state in the image's history, either by undoing or by
            using the Undo History dialog. (This must be done in the
            original, not the copy, because duplicating an image does not
            duplicate the Undo history.) Now activate the Clone tool,
            setting Source to <quote>Image source</quote> and Alignment to
            <quote>Registered</quote>. <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-click on a layer
            from one image, and paint on the corresponding layer from the
            other image. Depending on how you do it, this gives you either
            an <quote>undo brush</quote> or a <quote>redo brush</quote>.
