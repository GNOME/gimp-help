  <para>
    The advantages of using <acronym>GIMP</acronym> with a tablet instead of a
    mouse probably show up more clearly for brush tools than anywhere else:
    the gain in fine control is invaluable. These tools also have special
    <quote>Pressure sensitivity</quote> options that are only usable with a
    tablet.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition to the more common <quote>hands-on</quote> method, it is
    possible to apply paint tools in an automated way, by creating a selection
    or path and then <quote>stroking</quote> it.  You can choose to stroke
    with any of the paint tools, including nonstandard ones such as the
    Eraser, Smudge tool, etc., and any options you set for the tool will be
    applied.  See the section on
    <link linkend="gimp-selection-stroke">Stroking</link> for more
    information.

            Holding down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key has a special effect on

            Eraser, it switches them into <quote>color picker</quote> mode, so
            that clicking on an image pixel causes <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s
            foreground to be set to the active layer's color at that point
            (or, for the Eraser, <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s background color).
            For the Clone tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches it into
            a mode where clicking sets the reference point for copying. For
            the Convolve tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches between
            blur and sharpen modes; for the Dodge/Burn tool, it switches
            between dodging and burning.

            Holding down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key has the same effect on

            paint tools, first click on the starting point,
            <emphasis>then</emphasis> press the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key.
            As long as you hold it down, you will see a thin line connecting
            the previously clicked point with the current pointer location.
            If you click again, while continuing to hold down the
            <keycap>Shift</keycap> key, a straight line will be rendered. You
            can continue this process to create a series of connected line
            segments.

      Many tool options are shared by several paint tools: these are described

          <para>
            The Mode drop-down list provides a selection of paint
            application modes. As with the opacity, the easiest way to
            understand what the Mode setting does is to imagine that the
            paint is actually applied to a layer above the layer you are
            working on, with the layer combination mode in the Layers
            dialog set to the selected mode. You can obtain a great variety
            of special effects in this way. The Mode option is only usable
            for tools that can be thought of as adding color to the image:
            the Pencil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, Ink, and Clone tools. For the
            other paint tools, the option appears for the sake of
            consistency but is always grayed out. A list of modes can be
            found in <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes"/>.
          </para>
          <para>
            In this list, some modes are particular and are described

          <para>
            The Opacity slider sets the transparency level for the brush
            operation. To understand how it works, imagine that instead of
            altering the active layer, the tool creates a transparent layer
            above the active layer and acts on that layer. Changing Opacity in
            the Tool Options has the same effect that changing opacity in the
            Layers dialog would have in the latter situation. It controls the
            <quote>strength</quote>
            of all paint tools, not just those that paint on the active layer.
            In the case of the Eraser, this can come across as a bit
            confusing: it works out that the higher the <quote>opacity</quote>
            is, the more transparency you get.

            The brush determines how much of the image is affected by the
            tool, and how it is affected, when you trace out a brushstroke
            with the pointer. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> allows you to use
            several different types of brushes, which are described in the
            <link linkend="gimp-concepts-brushes">Brushes</link>
            section. The same brush choices are available for all paint tools
            except the Ink tool, which uses a unique type of procedurally
            generated brush. The colors of a brush only come into play for
            tools where they are meaningful: the Pencil, Paintbrush, and
            Airbrush tools. For the other paint tools, only the intensity
            distribution of a brush is relevant.

          <para>
            Brush dynamics let you map different brush parameters, commonly at
            least size and opacity, to one or more of three input dynamics:
            pressure, velocity and random. They are mostly used with tablets,
            but Velocity and Random are also usable with a mouse. The
            Ink tool, that supported velocity before, has been overhauled and
            now handles velocity-dependent painting much better.
          </para>
          <para>
            A new option has been added in stroking paths. Stoke Path and
            Stroke Selection have now a check box for emulating brush
            dynamics when you stroke using a paint tool. That means that when
            you stoke, brush pressure and velocity are varying along the length
            of the stroke. Pressure starts with zero, ramps up to full pressure
            and then ramps down again to no pressure. Velocity starts from
            zero and ramps up to full speed by the end of the stroke.
          </para>
          <para>
            The Pressure Sensitivity section is only meaningful if you are
            using a tablet:  it allows you to decide which aspects of the
            tool's action should be affected by how hard you press the stylus
            against the tablet.  The possibilities are
            <guilabel>opacity</guilabel>, <guilabel>hardness</guilabel>,
            <guilabel>rate</guilabel>, <guilabel>size</guilabel>, and
            <guilabel>color</guilabel>.  They  work together:  you can enable
            as many of them as you like.
            For each tool, only the ones that are meaningful are listed.
            Here is what they do:

            The Incremental check-box activates incremental mode for the tool.
            If it is deactivated, the maximum effect of a single stroke is
            determined by the opacity, and moving the brush repeatedly over
            the same spot will not increase the effect beyond this limit. If
            Incremental is active, each additional pass with the brush will
            increase the effect, but the opacity can't exceed the opacity set
            for the tool. This option is available for all paint tools except
            those which have a <quote>rate</quote>
            control, which automatically implies an incremental effect. See
            also <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes"/>.

            Instead of using the foreground color (as shown in the Color Area
            of the Toolbox), by checking the "Use color from gradient" option
            you can choose to paint with a gradient, giving colors that change
            gradually along the brush trajectory. For basic information on
            gradients, see the

            This mode applies paint only to transparent areas of the
            layer: the lower the opacity, the more paint is applied.
            Thus, painting opaque areas has no effect; painting
            transparent areas has the same effect as normal mode. The
            result is always an increase in opacity. Of course none of
            this is meaningful for layers that lack an alpha channel.

      operate at a sub-pixel level, in order to avoid producing jagged-looking
      results. One consequence of this is that even if you work with a
      hard-edged brush, such as one of the Circle brushes, pixels on the edge
      of the brushstroke will only be partially affected. If you need to have
      all-or-nothing effects (which may be necessary for getting a good
      selection, or for cutting and pasting, or for operating pixel-by-pixel
      at a high zoom level), use the Pencil tool, which makes all brushes
      perfectly hard and disables sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
