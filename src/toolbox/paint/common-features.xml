  <para>
    The advantages of using <acronym>GIMP</acronym> with a tablet instead of a
    mouse probably show up more clearly for brush tools than anywhere else:
    the gain in fine control is invaluable. These tools also have special
    <quote>Pressure sensitivity</quote> options that are only usable with a
    tablet.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition to the more common <quote>hands-on</quote> method, it is
    possible to apply paint tools in an automated way, by creating a selection
    or path and then <quote>stroking</quote> it.  You can choose to stroke
    with any of the paint tools, including nonstandard ones such as the
    Eraser, Smudge tool, etc., and any options you set for the tool will be
    applied.  See the section on
    <link linkend="gimp-selection-stroke">Stroking</link> for more
    information.

            Holding down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key has a special effect on

            that clicking on an image pixel causes <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s

            (or, for the Eraser, <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s background color).
            For the Clone tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches it into
            a mode where clicking sets the reference point for copying. For
            the Convolve tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches between

            <emphasis>then</emphasis> press the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key.
            As long as you hold it down, you will see a thin line connecting

            The Mode drop-down list provides a selection of paint
            application modes. As with the opacity, the easiest way to
            understand what the Mode setting does is to imagine that the
            paint is actually applied to a layer above the layer you are
            working on, with the layer combination mode in the Layers
            dialog set to the selected mode. You can obtain a great variety
            of special effects in this way. The Mode option is only usable
            for tools that can be thought of as adding color to the image:
            the Pencil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, Ink, and Clone tools. For the
            other paint tools, the option appears for the sake of
            consistency but is always grayed out. A list of modes can be
            found in <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes"/>.

            The Opacity slider sets the transparency level for the brush
            operation. To understand how it works, imagine that instead of
            altering the active layer, the tool creates a transparent layer
            above the active layer and acts on that layer. Changing Opacity in
            the Tool Options has the same effect that changing opacity in the
            Layers dialog would have in the latter situation. It controls the 
            <quote>strength</quote> of all paint tools, not just those that 
            paint on the active layer. In the case of the Eraser, this can 
            come across as a bit confusing: it works out that the higher the 
            <quote>opacity</quote> is, the more transparency you get.

            The brush determines how much of the image is affected by the
            tool, and how it is affected, when you trace out a brushstroke
            with the pointer. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> allows you to use
            several different types of brushes, which are described in the
            <link linkend="gimp-concepts-brushes">Brushes</link>
            section. The same brush choices are available for all paint tools
            except the Ink tool, which uses a unique type of procedurally
            generated brush. The colors of a brush only come into play for
            tools where they are meaningful: the Pencil, Paintbrush, and
            Airbrush tools. For the other paint tools, only the intensity
            distribution of a brush is relevant.

            narrow the height of the brush while a positive value between 0.00 
            and 20.00 indicates the narrowing rate of the width of the brush.

            Brush dynamics let you map different brush parameters to several

            When stroking paths and selections using a paint tool there is a an

            the length of the stroke. Pressure starts with zero, ramps up to 
            full pressure and then ramps down again to no pressure. Velocity 
            starts from zero and ramps up to full speed by the end of the

            The incremental check-box does not seems to work as everyone expect.
            If it is deactivated (the default value) the maximum effect of a 
            single stroke is determined by the opacity set in the opacity 
            slider. If the opacity is set to less than 100, moving the brush 
            over the same spot will increase the opacity if the brush is lifted 
            in the meantime. Painting over with the same stroke has no such 
            effect. If Incremental is active the brush will paint with full 
            opacity independent of the slider's setting. This option is available 
            for all paint tools except those which have a <quote>rate</quote> 
            control, which automatically implies an incremental effect. See

            For any paint tool with  opacity less than 100%, this very
            useful mode doesn't draw transparency but determines the
            probability of applying paint. This gives nice patterns of
            dots to paint-strokes or filling.

          <para>
            This mode applies paint only to transparent areas of the
            layer: the lower the opacity, the more paint is applied.
            Thus, painting opaque areas has no effect; painting
            transparent areas has the same effect as normal mode. The
            result is always an increase in opacity. Of course none of
            this is meaningful for layers that lack an alpha channel.

          <para>
            In the above example image, Wilber is on the top layer,
            surrounded by transparency. The lower layer is solid light
            blue. The Bucket Fill tool was used, with the
            <guilabel>Fill Whole Selection</guilabel> option checked
            and the entire layer was selected. A pattern was used to
            paint with the Bucket Fill tool.

            Three brushtrokes with pencil, red color at 100%, 50%, 25%: only
            transparent or semi-transparent pixels of the layer are painted.

            This mode erases the foreground color, replacing it with
            partial transparency. It acts like the
            <link linkend="plug-in-colortoalpha">Color to Alpha</link>
            filter, applied to the area under the brushstroke. Note that
            this only works on layers that possess an alpha channel;
            otherwise, this mode is identical to Normal.

            In the above example image, the color of the Bucket Fill tool

    <para>
      Advanced users may be interested to know that paint tools actually
      operate at a sub-pixel level, in order to avoid producing jagged-looking
      results. One consequence of this is that even if you work with a
      hard-edged brush, such as one of the Circle brushes, pixels on the edge
      of the brushstroke will only be partially affected. If you need to have
      all-or-nothing effects (which may be necessary for getting a good
      selection, or for cutting and pasting, or for operating pixel-by-pixel
      at a high zoom level), use the Pencil tool, which makes all brushes
      perfectly hard and disables sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
