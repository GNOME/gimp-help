    The <acronym>GIMP</acronym> Toolbox includes fourteen <quote>paint
    tools</quote>. By default they are shown together in five groups, but this

    The feature they all have in common is, that all of them are used by moving
    the pointer across the image display, creating brush-strokes. Five of them
    behave like the intuitive notion of <quote>painting</quote> with a brush.
    Pencil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, and MyPaint brush (introduced in GIMP 2.10.6)
    are called <quote>basic painting tools</quote> or

  <para>
    The advantages of using <acronym>GIMP</acronym> with a tablet instead of a
    mouse probably show up more clearly for brush tools than anywhere else:
    the gain in fine control is invaluable. These tools also have special
    <quote>Pressure sensitivity</quote> options that are only usable with a
    tablet.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition to the more common <quote>hands-on</quote> method, it is
    possible to apply paint tools in an automated way, by creating a selection
    or path and then <quote>stroking</quote> it.  You can choose to stroke
    with any of the paint tools, including nonstandard ones such as the
    Eraser, Smudge tool, etc., and any options you set for the tool will be
    applied.  See the section on
    <link linkend="gimp-selection-stroke">Stroking</link> for more
    information.

            Holding down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key has a special effect on

            Eraser, it switches them into <quote>color picker</quote> mode, so
            that clicking on an image pixel causes <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s
            foreground to be set to the active layer's color at that point
            (or, for the Eraser, <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s background color).
            For the Clone tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches it into
            a mode where clicking sets the reference point for copying. For
            the Blur/Sharpen tool, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key switches between
            blur and sharpen modes; for the Dodge/Burn tool, it switches
            between dodging and burning.

            Holding down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key has the same effect on

            paint tools, first click on the starting point,
            <emphasis>then</emphasis> press the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key.
            As long as you hold it down, you will see a thin line connecting
            the previously clicked point with the current pointer location.
            If you click again, while continuing to hold down the
            <keycap>Shift</keycap> key, a straight line will be rendered. You
            can continue this process to create a series of connected line

            except that the orientation of the line is constrained to the

          <para>
            The Mode drop-down list provides a selection of paint
            application modes. As with the opacity, the easiest way to
            understand what the Mode setting does is to imagine that the
            paint is actually applied to a layer above the layer you are
            working on, with the layer combination mode in the Layers
            dialog set to the selected mode. You can obtain a great variety
            of special effects in this way. The Mode option is only usable
            for tools that can be thought of as adding color to the image:
            the Pencil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, Ink, and Clone tools. For the
            other paint tools, the option is always disabled. A list of modes
            can be found in <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes"/>.
          </para>
          <para>

            The Opacity slider sets the transparency level for the brush
            operation. To understand how it works, imagine that instead of
            altering the active layer, the tool creates a transparent layer
            above the active layer and acts on that layer. Changing Opacity in
            the Tool Options has the same effect that changing opacity in the
            Layers dialog would have in the latter situation. It controls the 
            <quote>strength</quote> of all paint tools, not just those that 
            paint on the active layer. In the case of the Eraser, this can 
            come across as a bit confusing: it works out that the higher the 
            <quote>opacity</quote> is, the more transparency you get.

            The brush determines how much of the image is affected by the
            tool, and how it is affected, when you trace out a brushstroke
            with the pointer. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> allows you to use
            several different types of brushes, which are described in the
            <link linkend="gimp-concepts-brushes">Brushes</link>
            section. The same brush choices are available for all paint tools
            except the Ink tool, which uses a unique type of procedurally
            generated brush. The colors of a brush only come into play for
            tools where they are meaningful: the Pencil, Paintbrush, and
            Airbrush tools. For the other paint tools, only the intensity
            distribution of a brush is relevant.

            You can use the arrow keys to vary by ±0.01 or the Page-Up and

            you have correctly set your mouse-wheel in the Preferences. See

            default value set to 0.00. A negative value from 0.00 to -20 will 
            narrow the height of the brush while a positive value between 0.00 
            and 20.00 indicates the narrowing rate of the width of the brush.

            When you are working on an image that is bigger (in pixels) than 
            your screen, you have to zoom in and out a lot. This option 
            allows a very natural "iterative refinement" process with no need to 
            repeatedly ask the application to change brush size as you go 
            between the broad strokes and the detailing.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the brush size is relative to the canvas (option unchecked), 
            zooming in makes the brush zoomed also and it appears larger (takes 
            up more pixels on the screen). If you're working with a 300 pixels 
            radius brush and you zoom in from 12% to 100%, the brush is now 
            half the size of your screen! So you have to shrink the brush back 
            down.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the brush size is relative to the screen (option checked), then 
            when you zoom in, the size of the displayed brush doesn't change, it 
            looks smaller and so you can work on tiny details.

            The incremental checkbox does not seems to work as everyone expect.
            If it is deactivated (the default value) the maximum effect of a 
            single stroke is determined by the opacity set in the opacity 
            slider. If the opacity is set to less than 100, moving the brush 
            over the same spot will increase the opacity if the brush is lifted 
            in the meantime. Painting over with the same stroke has no such 
            effect. If Incremental is active the brush will paint with full 
            opacity independent of the slider's setting. This option is available 
            for all paint tools except those which have a <quote>rate</quote> 
            control, which automatically implies an incremental effect. See 
            also <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes"/>.

            This mode applies paint only to transparent areas of the
            layer: the lower the opacity, the more paint is applied.
            Thus, painting opaque areas has no effect; painting
            transparent areas has the same effect as normal mode. The
            result is always an increase in opacity. Of course none of
            this is meaningful for layers that lack an alpha channel.

      Advanced users may be interested to know that paint tools actually
      operate at a sub-pixel level, in order to avoid producing jagged-looking
      results. One consequence of this is that even if you work with a
      hard-edged brush, such as one of the Circle brushes, pixels on the edge
      of the brushstroke will only be partially affected. If you need to have
      all-or-nothing effects (which may be necessary for getting a good
      selection, or for cutting and pasting, or for operating pixel-by-pixel
      at a high zoom level), use the Pencil tool, which makes all brushes
      perfectly hard and disables sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
