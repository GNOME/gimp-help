          Three strokes painted with the same round fuzzy brush (outline shown
          in upper left), using the Pencil (left), Paintbrush (middle), and
          Airbrush (right).

  <para>
    The tools in this group are <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s basic painting
    tools, and they have enough features in common to be worth discussing
    together in this section. Features common to all paint tools are
    described in the
    <link linkend="gimp-tool-brush">Common Features</link>
    section. Features specific to an individual tool are described in the
    section devoted to that tool.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Pencil is the crudest of the tools in this group: it makes hard,
    non-anti-aliased brushstrokes. The Paintbrush is intermediate: it is
    probably the most commonly used of the group. The Airbrush is the most
    flexible and controllable. This flexibility also makes it a bit more
    difficult to use than the Paintbrush, however.
  </para>
  <para>
    All of these tools share the same brushes, and the same options for
    choosing colors, either from the basic palette or from a gradient. All are
    capable of painting in a wide variety of modes.

            Picker</link>: clicking on any pixel of any layer sets the
            foreground color (as displayed in the

            to the color of the pixel.

            This key places these tools into straight line mode. Holding
            <keycap>Shift</keycap> while clicking the mouse 
            <mousebutton>left&nbsp;Button</mousebutton> will generate a straight
            line. Consecutive clicks will continue drawing straight lines that
            originate from the end of the last line.
