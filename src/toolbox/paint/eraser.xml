  <para>
    The Eraser is used to remove areas of color from the current layer or from
    a selection of this layer. If the Eraser is used on something that does
    not support transparency (a selection mask channel, a layer mask, or the
    Background layer if it lacks an alpha channel), then erasing will show the
    background color, as displayed in the Color Area of the Toolbox (in case
    of a mask, the selection will be modified). Otherwise, erasing will
    produce either partial or full transparency, depending on the settings for
    the tool options. You can learn more on how to add an alpha channel to a
    layer in <xref linkend="gimp-layer-alpha-add"/>.

  <para>
    If you need to erase some group of pixels completely, leaving no trace
    behind of their previous contents, you should check the "Hard edge" box in
    the Tool Options. Otherwise, sub-pixel brush placement will cause partial
    erasure at the edges of the brush-stroke, even if you use a hard-edged
    brush.
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para>
      If you use GIMP with a tablet, you may find it convenient to treat the
      reverse end of the stylus as an eraser. To make this work, all you need
      to do is click the reverse end on the Eraser tool in the Toolbox.
      Because each end of the stylus is treated as a separate input device,
      and each input device has its own separate tool assignment, the reverse
      end will then continue to function as an Eraser as long as you don't
      select a different tool with it.

          <para>
            For the Eraser, holding down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key puts it
            into <quote>color picker</quote> mode, so that it selects the
            color of any pixel it is clicked on. Unlike other brush tools,
            however, the Eraser sets the <emphasis>background</emphasis>
            color rather than the foreground color. This is more useful,
            because on drawables that don't support transparency, erasing
            replaces the erased areas with the current background color.

            <keycap>Alt</keycap> key is trapped by the Window Manager. If this
            happens to you, you may be able to use
            <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Shift</keycap></keycombo>
            instead.

            opacity you use, the more transparency you get!

            The Anti Erase option of the Erase tool can un-erase areas of an
            image, even if they are completely transparent. This feature only
            works when used on layers with an alpha channel. In addition to
            the check-button in the Tool Options, it can also be activated
            on-the-fly by holding down the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key (or, if
            the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key is trapped by the Window Manager, by
            holding down
            <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Shift</keycap></keycombo>).
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              To understand how anti-erasing is possible, you should realize
              that erasing (or cutting, for that matter) only affects the
              alpha channel, not the RGB channels that contain the image data.
              Even if the result is completely transparent, the RGB data is
              still there, you simply can't see it. Anti-erasing increases the
              alpha value so that you can see the RGB data once again.

              An annoying feature: on a layer you have created with a
              transparent background, using anti-erasing on non-painted areas
              paints with black!
