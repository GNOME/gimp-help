  <para>
    The Blur/Sharpen tool uses the current brush to locally blur or sharpen your
    image. Blurring with it can be useful if some element of your image stands
    out too much, and you would like to soften it. If you want to blur a whole
    layer, or a large part of one, you will probably be better off using one
    of the <link linkend="filters-blur">Blur Filters</link>.
    The direction of a brushstroke has no effect: if you want directional
    blurring, use the Smudge tool.
  </para>
  <para>
    In <quote>Sharpen</quote> mode, the tool works by increasing the contrast
    where the brush is applied.  A little bit of this may be useful, but
    over-application will produce noise.  Some of the
    <link linkend="filters-enhance">Enhancement Filters</link>, particularly
    the <link linkend="plug-in-unsharp-mask">Unsharp Mask</link>, do a
    much cleaner job of sharpening areas of a layer.
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para>
      You can create a more sophisticated sharpening brush using the Clone
      tool. To do this, start by duplicating the layer you want to work on,
      and run a sharpening filter, such as Unsharp Mask, on the copy. Then
      activate the Clone tool, and in its Tool Options set Source to
      <quote>Image source</quote> and Alignment to <quote>Registered</quote>.
      Set the Opacity to a modest value, such as 10. Then
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-click on the copy to make it the source image. If
      you now paint on the original layer, you will mix together, where the
      brush is applied, the sharpened version with the unsharpened version.
    </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
    Both blurring and sharpening work incrementally: moving the brush
    repeatedly over an area will increase the effect with each additional
    pass. The Rate control allows you to determine how quickly the
    modifications accumulate. The Opacity control, however, can be used to
    limit the amount of blurring that can be produced by a single brushstroke,
    regardless of how many passes are made with it.

            mode causes each pixel affected by the brush to be blended with
            neighboring pixels, thereby increasing the similarity of pixels
            inside the brushstroke area. <emphasis>Sharpen</emphasis>
            mode causes each pixel to become more different from its neighbors
            than it previously was: it increases contrast inside the
            brushstroke area. Too much Sharpen ends in an ugly flocculation
            aspect. Whatever setting you choose here, you can reverse
            it on-the-fly by holding down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key.
