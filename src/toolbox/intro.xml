  <title>The Toolbox</title>

  <indexterm>

  </indexterm>

  <para>
    The <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
    provides a comprehensive toolbox in order to quickly perform basic tasks
    such as making selections or drawing paths. The many tools contained
    within The <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s toolbox are discussed in detail here.
  </para>
  <para>
    (In case you're curious, in GIMP lingo a "tool" is a way of acting on an
    image that requires access to its display, either to let you indicate what
    you want to do by moving the pointer around inside the display, or to show
    you interactively the results of changes that you have made. But if you
    want to think of a tool as a saw, and an image as a piece of wood, it
    probably won't do you a great deal of harm.)
  </para>
  <para>
    GIMP has a diverse assortment of tools that let you perform a large
    variety of tasks. The tools can be thought of as falling into five
    categories: <emphasis>Selection tools</emphasis>,
    which specify or modify the portion of the image that will be affected
    by subsequent actions; <emphasis>Paint tools</emphasis>,
    which alter the colors in some part of the image;
    <emphasis>Transform tools</emphasis>, which alter the geometry of the
    image; <emphasis>Color tools</emphasis>, which alter the distribution of
    colors across the entire image; and <emphasis>Other tools</emphasis>,
    which don't fall into the other four categories.
  </para>
  <para>
    Most tools can be activated by clicking on an icon in the Toolbox.
    Some, however (namely, the Color tools), are accessible only via
    the menus, either as
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Colors</guimenu>
    </menuchoice>
    or as
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Colors</guisubmenu>
    </menuchoice>.
    Every tool, in fact, can be activated from the <emphasis>Tools</emphasis>
    menu; also, every tool can be activated from the keyboard using an
    accelerator key.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the default setup, created when GIMP is first installed, not all tools
    show icons in the Toolbox: the Color tools are omitted. You can customize
    the set of tools that are shown in the Toolbox using the
    <link linkend="gimp-tools-dialog">Tools dialog</link>.
    There are two reasons you might want to do this: first, if you only
    rarely use a tool, it might be easier to find the tools you want if the
    distracting icon is removed; second, if you use the Color tools a lot, you
    might find it convenient to have icons for them easily available. In any
    case, regardless of the Toolbox, you can always access any tool at any
    time using the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu from an image menubar.
  </para>
  <para>
    The shape of the cursor changes when it is inside an image, to one that
    indicates which tool is active (if in <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> you have
    set
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Image Windows</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Mouse Pointers</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Pointer mode</guimenuitem>
      <guimenuitem>Tool icon</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>).
  </para>

    <para>
      If you have things set up like most people do, activating a tool causes
      its Tool Options dialog to appear below the Toolbox. If you don't have
      things set up this way, you probably should: it is very difficult to use
      tools effectively without being able to manipulate their options.
    </para>
    <tip>
      <para>
        The Tool Options appear beneath the Toolbox in the default
        setup.  If you lose it somehow, you can get it back by creating
        a new Tool Options dialog using
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
          <guisubmenu>Dockable Dialogs</guisubmenu>
          <guimenuitem>Tool Options</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        and then docking it below the Toolbox. See the section on
        <link linkend="gimp-concepts-docks">Dialogs and Docking</link> if you
        need help.
      </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
      Each tool has its own specific set of options. The choices you make for
      them are kept throughout the session, until you change them. In fact,
      the tool options are maintained from session to session. The persistance
      of tool options across sessions can sometimes be an annoying nuisance: a
      tool behaves very strangely, and you can't figure out why until you
      remember that you were using some unusual option the last time you
      worked with it, two weeks ago.
    </para>
    <para>
      At the bottom of the Tool Options dialog appear four buttons:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          <guiicon>
            <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/toolbox/reg-button.png"/>
              </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
          </guiicon>
          <phrase>Save Options to</phrase>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This button allows you to save the settings for the current tool,
            so that you can restore them later. It brings up a small dialog
            allowing you to give a name to the array of saved options. When
            you Restore options, only saved sets for the active tool are
            shown, so you need not worry about including the name of the tool
            when you assign a name here.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This button allows you to restore a previously saved set of
            options for the active tool. If no option-sets have ever been
            saved for the active tool, the button will be insensitive.
            Otherwise, clicking it will bring up a menu showing the names of
            all saved option sets: choosing a menu entry will apply those
            settings.

            This button allows you to delete a previously saved set of options
            for the active tool. If no option-sets have ever been saved for
            the active tool, the button will be insensitive. Otherwise,
            clicking it will bring up a menu showing the names of all saved
            option sets: choosing a menu entry will delete those settings.
