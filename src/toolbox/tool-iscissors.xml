  <para>
    The Intelligent Scissors tool is an interesting piece of equipment: it has
    some features in common with the Lasso, some features in common with the
    Path tool, and some features all its own. It is useful when you are trying
    to select a region defined by strong color-changes at the edges. To use
    the Scissors, you click to create a set of "control nodes", also referred to
    as anchors or control points, at the edges of
    the region you are trying to select. The tool produces a continuous curve
    passing through these control nodes, following any high-contrast edges it
    can find. If you are lucky, the path that the tool finds will correspond
    to the contour you are trying to select.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each time you left-click with the mouse, you create a new control point,
    which is connected to the last control point by a curve that tries to
    follow edges in the image. To finish, click on the first point (the cursor
    changes to indicate when you are in the right spot). You can adjust the
    curve by dragging the control nodes, or by clicking to create new control
    nodes. When you are satisfied, click anywhere inside the curve to convert
    it into a selection.
  </para>
  <para>
    Unfortunately, there seem to be some problems with the edge-following
    logic for this tool, with the result that the selections it creates tend
    to be pretty crude in a lot of cases. A good way to clean them up is to
    switch to <link linkend="gimp-qmask">QuickMask</link>
    mode, and use paint tools to paint in the problematic parts. On the whole,
    most people find the Path tool to be more useful than the Scissors,
    because, even though it does not have the intelligent edge-finding
    capability, the paths it produces persist until you delete them, and can
    be altered at any time.

      The Scissor tool does not have any special key modifiers, only the ones
      that affect all selection tools in the same way. See

      As said above when you click with this tool you drop points. The
      selection boundary is driven by these control points. During creation you
      can move each one by clicking and dragging, except the first and the last
      one. The selection is closed when you are clicking the last point over
      the first one. When the selection is closed the pointer shape
      changes according to its position:  inside
      <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/toolbox/cissors-mouse.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>
      , on the boundary
      <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/toolbox/cissors-plus.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>
      and outside
      <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/toolbox/cissors-bad.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>
      . You can adjust the selection creating new points by clicking on the
      boundary or by moving each control points (merged first and last
      point). The selection is validated when you click inside.
    </para>
    <para>
      You have to notice that you can get only one selection; if you
      create a second selection, the first one is erased when you validate the
      second one.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
        Be sure not to click inside the curve until you are completely done
        adjusting it. Once you have converted it into a selection, undoing
        takes you back to zero, and you will have to to start constructing the
        curve again from scratch if you need to change it. Also be sure not to
        switch to a different tool, or again all of your carefully created
        control nodes will be lost. (But you still can transform your
        selection into a path and work it with the Path tool.)

          If this option is enabled, dragging a control node during
          placement will indicate the path that will be taken by the
          selection boundary. If it is not enabled, the node will be shown
          connected to the previous node by a straight line while you are
          dragging it around, and you won't see the resulting path until you
          release the pointer button. On slow systems, if your control nodes
          are far apart, this may give a bit of a speed-up.
