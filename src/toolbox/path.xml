    The Paths tool allows to create complex selections called Bézier Curves, a
    bit like the Free Selection tool but with all the adaptability of vectorial
    curves. You can edit your curve, you can paint with your curve, or even
    save, import, and export the curve. You can also use paths to create
    geometrical figures. Paths have their own dialog box:

                  Curved segments are easily built by dragging a segment or a
                  new node. Blue arrows indicate curve. Two little handles
                  appear that you can drag to bend the curve.

              When you have two handles, they work symmetrically by
              default.  Release the pressure on the mouse button to move
              handles individually. The <keycap>Shift</keycap> key will
              force the handles to be symmetrical again.

          <para>Several functions are available in Design mode:</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Inserting a new node</emphasis>:
            When you press <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and hover the mouse pointer
            over the existing path, the mouse pointer changes to the '+'
            sign. Clicking will create a new path node in the hovered point
            of the path.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Moving one or several nodes</emphasis>: On a node,
            the mouse pointer becomes a 4-arrows cross. You can click
            and drag it.
            You can select several nodes by <keycap>Shift</keycap> and
            click and move them by click and drag.
            Pressing <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt
            </keycap></keycombo> allows to move all the path, as a
            selection.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Modifying handles</emphasis>: You have to Edit a node
            first. A handle appears. Drag it to bend the curve.
            Pressing <keycap>Shift</keycap> toggles to symmetric handles.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Modify segment</emphasis>: When the mouse pointer
            moves over a segment, it turns to a 4-arrows cross. Click and drag
            it to bend the segment. As soon as you move it, handles appear
            at both ends of the segment. Pressing the <keycap>Shift</keycap>
            key toggles to symmetric handles.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Adding a new subpath</emphasis>:
            When you press <keycap>Shift</keycap> and hover the mouse pointer
            outside the existing path, the mouse pointer starts displaying
            a square. Clicking will start a subpath that isn't connected
            to other curves, but is considered a part of the path.

            available in <guilabel>Design</guilabel> mode. With this
            mode, you can work only on the existing path. When the mouse
            pointer is not on the path, the pointer changes to a small crossed
            circle and you can not do any path editing.
          </para>
          <para>
            <emphasis>Add a segment between two nodes</emphasis>: Click
            on a node at one end of the path to activate it. The pointer is
            like a union symbol. Click on an other node to link both
            nodes. This is useful when you have to link unclosed
            components.

            Pressing <keycap>Shift</keycap> toggles to symmetric
            handles.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            This button allows creation of a selection that is based on
            the path in its present state. This selection is marked with
            the usual "marching ants". Note that the path is still present:
            the current tool is still the path tool and you can modify this
            path without modifying the selection that has become independent.
            If you change tools, the path becomes invisible, but it persists in
            the <link linkend="gimp-path-dialog">Paths dialog</link> and you
            can re-activate it.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the path is not closed, GIMP will close it with a straight line.

          <para>
            As the help pop-up tells, pressing <keycap>Shift</keycap>
            when clicking on the button will add the new selection to an
            already existing one. Pressing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> will
            subtract the selection from the pre-existing selection, and the
            <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Ctrl</keycap></keycombo>
            key combination will intersect the two selections.
