    Normally, tool options are displayed in a window attached under the
    Toolbox as soon as you activate a tool. If they are not, you can access
    them from the main menu through
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Dockable Windows</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Tool Options</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice> which opens the option window of the selected tool.
    The available tool options can also be accessed by double clicking
    the corresponding tool icon in the Toolbox.
