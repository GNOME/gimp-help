          Three strokes painted with the same round fuzzy brush (outline shown
          in upper left), using the Pencil (left), Paintbrush (middle), and
          Airbrush (right).

  <para>
    The tools in this group are GIMP's basic painting tools, and they have
    enough features in common to be worth discussing together in this section.
    Features common to all brush tools are described in the
    <link linkend="gimp-tool-brush">Common Features</link>
    section. Features specific to an individual tool are described in the
    section devoted to that tool.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Pencil is the crudest of the tools in this group: it makes hard,
    non-anti-aliased brushstrokes. The Paintbrush is intermediate: it is
    probably the most commonly used of the group. The Airbrush is the most
    flexible and controllable: it is the only one for which the amount of
    paint applied depends on the speed of brush movement. This flexibility
    also makes it a bit more difficult to use than the Paintbrush, however.
  </para>
  <para>
    All of these tools share the same brushes, and the same options for
    choosing colors, either from the basic palette or from a gradient. All are
    capable of painting in a wide variety of modes.
