  <para>
    The Fuzzy Select (Magic Wand) tool is designed to select areas of the
    current layer or image based on color similarity.
  </para>
  <para>
    When using this tool, it is very important to pick the right starting
    point. If you select the wrong spot, you might get something very
    different from what you want, or even the opposite.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Wand is a good tool for selecting objects with sharp edges. It is fun
    to use, so beginners often start out using it a lot. You will probably
    find, however, that the more you use it, the more frustrated you become
    with the difficulty of selecting exactly what you want, no more, no less.
    More experienced users find that the
    <link linkend="gimp-tool-path">Path</link> and
    <link linkend="gimp-tool-by-color-select">Color Select</link>
    tools are often more efficient, and use the Wand less. Still, it is useful
    for selecting an area within a contour, or touching up imperfect
    selections. It often works very well for selecting a solid-colored (or nearly
    solid-colored) background area.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that as the selected area expands outward from the center, it does
    not only propagate to pixels that touch each other: it is capable of
    jumping over small gaps, depending on <guilabel>Threshold</guilabel> option.
    To increase/decrease Threshold, during the use of Fuzzy Selection, after the
    first button-press, dragging the pointer downward (or to the right) or
    upward (or to the left).

    <title>Key modifiers (Defaults)</title>
    <para>
      The Fuzzy Select tool does not have any special key modifiers, only the
      ones that affect all selection tools in the same way. See
      <xref linkend="gimp-tool-select"/> for help with these.

    <para>
      It starts selecting when you click at a spot in the image, and expands
      outwards like water flooding low-lying areas, selecting contiguous
      pixels whose colors are similar to the starting pixel. You can control
      the threshold of similarity by dragging the mouse downward or to the
      right: the farther you drag it, the larger you get the selected region.
      And you can reduce the selection by dragging upwards or to the left.

                <para>
                  This option gives the Magic Wand the ability to select areas
                  that are completely transparent. If this option is not
                  checked, transparent areas will never be included in the
                  selection.

              <listitem>
                <para>
                  This option becomes relevant when you have several layers in
                  your image, and the active layer is either semi-transparent
                  or is set to another Layer Mode than Normal. If this is the
                  case, the colors present in the layer will be different from
                  the colors in the composite image. If the
                  <quote>Sample Merged</quote>
                  option is unchecked, the wand will only react to the color
                  in the active layer when it creates a selection. If it is
                  checked it will react to the composite color of all visible
                  layers. For further information, see the glossary entry
                  <link linkend="glossary-samplemerge">Sample Merged</link>.

              <listitem>
                <para>
                  This slider determines the range of colors that will be
                  selected at the moment you click the pointer on the initial
                  point, before dragging it: the higher the threshold, the
                  larger the resulting selection. After the first
                  button-press, dragging the pointer downward or to the right
                  will increase the size of the selection; dragging upward or
                  to the left will decrease it. Thus, you have the same set of
                  possibilities regardless of the Threshold setting: what
                  differs is the amount of dragging you have to do to get the
                  result you want.
