  <para>
    This tool lets you extract the foreground from the active layer or from a
    selection. After the selection is made, with its marching ants, you can
    copy-paste or click-and-drag it to another image used as background, and,
    inverting the selection, you can make changes in background.

    <para>
      Let us start with an object that is easy to distinguish from the
      background and doesn't need to be refined.
    </para>
    <warning>
      <para>
        The foreground select tool needs a lot of memory for its processing,
        depending on the size of the image. It is known to crash or slow down
        when using larger images.
      </para>
      <para>
        One way to improve this is to use <guilabel>Matting Global</guilabel>
        instead of <guilabel>Matting Levin</guilabel>. The slow processing
        speed can be improved by increasing the number of downsampled
        <guilabel>Levels</guilabel>, at the cost of using more memory. Both of
        these options also come with the disadvantage of being less accurate.
      </para>
    </warning>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          The way it works is similar to the
          <link linkend="gimp-tool-free-select">Free Select tool</link>.
          Roughly select the object you want to extract, with a little bit of
          background around it.
          To get a more accurate outline, keep the mouse button pressed while
          moving. To use straight lines for parts of your selection, click
          and release the button between the start and end points of the
          straight section.
        </para>
        <para>
          As soon you click to start drawing the selection, a small window pops
          up:
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata format="PNG"
                fileref="images/toolbox/FG-select-pop-up.png"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
          Before the selection is finished, only the button to close the dialog
          is active, allowing you to cancel and return to the original image
          (this can also be done by pressing the <keycap>Esc</keycap> key).
        </para>
        <para>
          To finish the initial selection, it needs to be closed. When the mouse
          cursor hovers over the dot where you started the selection, it turns
          yellow. Click this to close the selection. Instead of doing that,
          you can also double-click to close the selection.
        </para>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata format="PNG"

         </mediaobject>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          To create the mask from your selection, press <keycap>Enter</keycap>,
          or double-click inside the selection:
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

          </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
          The mouse pointer now changes into a Paintbrush icon with a circle.
          The dark blue area (this color can be changed) shows the background.
          The lighter area covers the zone you have selected as foreground and
          a small part of background.
          Outside the selected area, the dark blue area is called the
          <quote>Unknown pixels area</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The options in the small window on top of the image become active:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                A <guilabel>Preview mask</guilabel> checkbox that toggles
                displaying a preview of the foreground extraction status.
                The same can also be done by pressing the
                <keycap>Enter</keycap> key.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                A <guibutton>Select</guibutton> button that will be used to 
                create the extraction after marking the foreground.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>
          Now we start the actual foreground extraction process: draw a line
          through the foreground. The size of the brush can be changed in the
          Tool Options area. Draw a continuous line over the selected foreground
          area moving over colors which will be kept for the extraction. The
          color used to draw the line is not important, but not using the same
          color as the foreground makes it easier to see. Be careful not to
          paint background pixels.

    <title>Refining Foreground Extraction</title>
    <para>
      In a lot of images, distinguishing what is foreground or background can be
      difficult. Refining the selection allows you to extract these foregrounds.
      The procedure steps are the same as above, but, while drawing the
      foreground, you will often toggle Preview, use Zoom (<keycap>+</keycap>
      key), switch to <guilabel>Draw background</guilabel> to delete unwanted
      background areas, and switch between <guilabel>Grayscale</guilabel> and
      <guilabel>Color</guilabel> preview mode.
