    <para>
      Moving selections has changed with GIMP-v2.4. Rectangular and
      elliptical selections now show up in two modes. Default mode is with
      handles. If you click the selection, you only get the dotted outline
      (marching ants). The other selection tools have different behaviour.
    </para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Moving rectangular and elliptical selections</title>
      <para>
        If you click-and drag the selection in default mode, you move the
        selection outline and you don't move the contents of rectangular or
        elliptic selections.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also use the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-move">Move </link> tool to move the selection
        outline.

      <para>
        You can also use <keycap>Alt</keycap> (or
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo> on some
        systems) and the arrow keys to move the selection outline one by one
        pixel. With
        <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo> and
        arrow keys you can move it by 25 pixels steps.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you click-and-drag the selection without handles, you create a new

            keys and click-and-drag the selection. This makes the original

        <para>
          On some systems, it's preferable to push first the
          <keycap>Alt</keycap> key, otherwise if you push first the
          <keycap>Shift</keycap> or <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> keys, GIMP will
          fall over add/subtract to the current selection mode and after
          that, the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key is ineffective!

    <sect3>
      <title>Moving the other selections</title>
      <para>
        The other selections (Lasso, Magic wand, By Color) have no handle.
        Click-and dragging them doesn't move them. To move their contents, as
        with rectangular and elliptical selections, you have to hold down
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo> keys
        or <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>
        and click-and-drag.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you use keyboard arrow keys instead of click-and-drag, you move
        the outline.

      <title>Other method</title>
      <note>
        <para>
          You can also use a more roundabout method to move a selection. Make
          it floating. Then you can move its content, emptying the origin, by
          click-and-dragging or keyboard arrow keys. To move without emptying,
          use copy-paste.

    <para>
      When drawing a selection, you can add a part of the image
      or subtract a part of the selection by holding the
      <keycap>Shift</keycap> or the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> keyboard keys down:

    <para>
      A rectangular has been drawn. Then the Lasso is selected and a free hand
      selection is drawn, holding the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key down,
      including a part of the rectangular selection. As soon as you release
      the mouse button, both selections are added.
