    <para>
      Rectangular and elliptical selections have two modes. The default
      mode has handles on the selection. If you click the selection or
      press the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key,the handles disappear leaving
      only the dotted outline (marching ants). The other selection tools have
      different behaviour.
    </para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Moving rectangular and elliptical selections</title>
      <para>
        If you click-and drag a selection with handles, you move the
        selection outline, and you don't move the contents of rectangular or
        elliptic selections.
      </para>
      <para>
         Select the <link linkend="gimp-tool-move">Move </link> tool and set
         the options to move the selection; the tool supports moving the
         selection, path, or layer.

      <para>
        Most systems support moving the selection using the arrow keys.
        The precise behavior is system dependent. If the arrow keys do not
        cause the selection to move, try hovering the mouse cursor over the
        selection first. Press and hold the <keycap>Alt</keycap> (or
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>, 
        <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>, or
        <keycap>Alt</keycap>). One combination may move the selection by one
        pixel, and another by 25 pixels each step. Hover the mouse cursor over
        a side or corner handle, and the arrow keys and combinations can
        change the size of the selection.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you click-and-drag the selection without handles, you create a new
        selection! To move the selection contents, you have to
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>

            hold down

            keys and click-and-drag the selection. This makes the original
            place empty. A floating selection is created.
            The required key commands may differ on your system, look in the
            status bar to see if another combination is specified; for
            example,
            <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
            <keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>.

        <para>
          On some systems, you must push <keycap>Alt</keycap> before
          <keycap>Shift</keycap> or <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>. On these
          systems, pressing <keycap>Shift</keycap> or <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
          first, causes GIMP to enter a mode that adds or subtract from the
          current selection &mdash; after
          that, the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key is ineffective!

      <title>Moving the other selections</title>
      <para>
        The other selections (Lasso, Magic wand, By Color) have no handle.
        Click-and dragging them doesn't move them. To move their contents, as
        with rectangular and elliptical selections, you have to hold down
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo> keys
        or <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>
        and click-and-drag.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you use keyboard arrow keys instead of click-and-drag, you move
        the outline.

      <title>Other method</title>
      <note>
        <para>
          You can also use a more roundabout method to move a selection. Make
          it floating. Then you can move its content, emptying the origin, by
          click-and-dragging or keyboard arrow keys. To move without emptying,
          use copy-paste.

          a selection replaces any existing selection.

        <listitem><para>
          Add mode, causes new selections to be added to any existing
          selection. Press and hold the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key while
          making a selection to temporarily enter add mode.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          Subtract mode, causes new selections to be removed from any existing
          selection. Press and hold the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key while
          making a selection to temporarily enter subtract mode.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          Intersect mode, causes areas in both the new and
          existing selection to become the new selection.
          Press and hold both the <keycap>Shift</keycap> and
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key while
          making a selection to temporarily enter intersect mode.
