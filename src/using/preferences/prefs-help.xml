          <para>
            Tool tips are small help pop-ups that appear when the pointer
            hovers for a moment over some element of the interface, such as a
            button or icon. Sometimes they explain what the element does;
            sometimes they give you hints about non-obvious ways to use it.
            If you find them too distracting, you can disable them here by
            unchecking this option. We recommend that you leave them enabled
            unless you are a very advanced user.

            This option controls whether the help buttons are shown
            on every tool dialog, which may be used alternatively to
            invoke the help system.

            Start-up tips are helpful hints that appear each time you start
            GIMP. You can switch them on or off here. If you have switched
            them off by unchecking
            <quote>Show tip next time GIMP starts</quote>
            in the tip window, you can switch them back on by checking here.
            Whatever you decide to do, at some point you should take the time
            to go through the list of tips: they are considered to be very
            useful, and the things they tell you are not easy to discover by
            experimenting. If you prefer, you can read them at any time by
            choosing

          <para>
            GIMP Help is supplied in the form of HTML files, i. e., web pages.
            You can view them using either a special help browser that comes
            with GIMP, or a web browser of your choice. Here you choose which
            option to use. Because the help pages were carefully checked to
            make sure they work well with GIMP's browser, whereas other web
            browsers are somewhat variable in their support of features, the
            safer option is to use the internal browser; but really any
            modern web browser should be okay.
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Note that the GIMP help browser is not available on all 
              platforms. If it is missing, this option is hidden and the
              standard web browser will be used to read the help pages.
