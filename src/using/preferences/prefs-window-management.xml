    This page lets you customize the way windows are handled in GIMP. You
    should note that GIMP does not manipulate windows directly, instead it
    sends requests to the window manager (i. e., to Windows if you are running
    in Windows; to Metacity if you are running in a standard Gnome setup in
    Linux; etc). Because there are many window managers, and not all of them
    are well behaved, it cannot be guaranteed that the functions described
    here will actually work as described. However, if you are using a modern,
    standards-compliant window manager, they ought to.

            The choices you make here determine how the Toolbox, and the docks
            that hold dialogs, will be treated. You have three possibilities
            for them:

            Normally, when you focus an image window (usually indicated by a
            change in the color of the frame), it becomes the <quote>active
            image</quote> for GIMP, and therefore the target for any
            image-related actions you perform.  Some people, though, prefer
            to set up their window managers such that any window entered by
            the pointer is automatically focused.  If you do this, you
            may find that it is inconvenient for focused images to
            automatically become active, and may be happier if you uncheck
            this option.

            If this option is checked, the next time you start GIMP,
            you will see the same set of dialog windows, in the same
            positions they occupied when you last exited.

            This button is only useful if "Save window positions on exit" is
            unchecked. It allows you to set up your windows they way you like,
            click the button, and then have them come up in that arrangement
            each time you start GIMP.

            If you decide that you are unhappy with the arrangement of windows
            you have saved, and would rather go back to the default
            arrangement than spend time moving them around, you can do so by
            pressing this button.
