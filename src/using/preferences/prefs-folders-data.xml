  <para>
    GIMP uses several types of resources – such as brushes, patterns,
    gradients, etc. – for which a basic set are supplied by GIMP when it is
    installed, and others can be created or downloaded by the user. For each
    such resource type, there is a Preference page that allows you to specify
    the <emphasis>search path</emphasis>:
    the set of directories from which items of the type in question are
    automatically loaded when GIMP starts. These pages all look very much the
    same: the page for brushes is shown to the right as an example.
  </para>
  <para>
    By default, the search path includes two folders:  a
    <emphasis>system</emphasis> folder, where items installed along
    with GIMP are placed, and a <emphasis>personal</emphasis> folder,
    inside your personal GIMP directory, where items added by you
    should be placed.  The system folder should not be marked as
    writable, and you should not try to alter its contents.  The
    personal folder must be marked as writable or it is useless,
    because there is nothing inside it except what you put there.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can customize the search path with the buttons at the top of
    the dialog.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <title>Options</title>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Select a Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click on one of the folders in the list, it is selected for
          whatever action comes next.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Add/Replace Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you type the name of a folder in the entry space, or navigate to
          it using the file chooser button
          <guiicon>
            <inlinegraphic fileref="images/dialogs/stock-fileopen-16.png"/>
          </guiicon>
          on the right, and then click the
          left button, this will replace the selected folder with the one you
          have specified. If nothing in the list is selected, the folder you
          specify will be added to the list. If the light-symbol to the left
          of the text entry area is red instead of green, it means that the
          folder you have specified does not exist. GIMP will not create it
          for you, so you should do this immediately.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Move Up/Down</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click on the up-arrow or down-arrow buttons, the selected
          folder will be changed to the following or preceding one in the
          list. Since the folders are read in order, using those buttons
          change the loading precedence of the items located in those folders.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Delete Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click the trash-can button, the selected folder will be
          deleted from the list. (The folder itself is not affected; it is
          merely removed from the search path.) Deleting the system folder is
          probably a bad idea, but nothing prevents you from doing it.
