    A <emphasis>palette</emphasis> is a set of discrete
    colors.  In GIMP, palettes are used mainly for two purposes:

        They allow you to paint with a selected set of colors, in the
        same way an oil painter works with colors from a limited
        number of tubes.

        They form the colormaps of indexed images.  An indexed image
        can use a maximum of 256 different colors, but these can be
        any colors.  The colormap of an indexed image is called an
        "indexed palette" in GIMP.

    Actually neither of these functions fall very much into the
    mainstream of GIMP usage:  it is possible to do rather
    sophisticated things in GIMP without every dealing with palettes.
    Still, they are something that an advanced user should understand,
    and even a less advanced user may need to think about them in
    some situations, as for example when working with GIF files.

    When you install GIMP, it comes supplied with several dozen
    predefined palettes, and you can also create new ones.  Some of
    the predefined palettes are commonly useful, such as the "Web"
    palette, which contains the set of colors considered "web safe";
    many of the palettes seem to have been chosen more or less
    whimsically.  You can access all of the available palettes using
    the <link linkend='gimp-palette-dialog'>Palettes dialog</link>.
    This is also the starting point if you want to create a new
    palette.

  <para lang='en'>
    Double-clicking on a palette in the Palettes dialog brings up the
    <link linkend='gimp-palette-editor-dialog'>Palette Editor</link>, showing
    the colors from the palette you clicked 
    on.  You can use this to paint with the palette:  clicking on a
    color sets GIMP's foreground to that color, as shown in the Color
    Area of the Toolbox.  Holding down the Ctrl key while clicking, on
    the other hand, sets GIMP's background color to the color you
    click on.   
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    You can also, as the name implies, use the Palette Editor to
    change the colors in a palette, so long as it is a palette that
    you have created yourself.  You cannot edit the palettes that are
    supplied with GIMP; however you can duplicate them and then edit
    the copies.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    When you create palettes using the Palette Editor, they are
    automatically saved as soon as you exit GIMP, in the
    <filename>palettes</filename> folder of your personal GIMP
    directory.  Any palette files in this directory, or in the system
    <filename>palettes</filename> directory created when GIMP is
    installed, are automatically loaded and shown in the Palettes
    dialog the next time you start GIMP.  You can also add other
    folders to the palette search path using the <link
    linkend='gimp-prefs-folders-data'>Palette Folders</link> page of
    the Preferences dialog.

  <para lang='en'>
    GIMP palettes are stored using a special file format, in files
    with the extension <filename>.gpl</filename>.  It is a very simple
    format, and they are ASCII files, so if you happen to obtain
    palettes from another source, and would like to use them in GIMP,
    it probably won't be very hard to convert them:  just take a look
    at any <filename>.gpl</filename> and you will see what to do.

    <title lang='en'>Indexed Palettes</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      Confusingly, GIMP makes use of two types of palettes.  The more
      noticeable are the type shown in the Palettes dialog:  palettes
      that exist independently of any image.  The second type,
      <emphasis>indexed palettes</emphasis>, form the colormaps of
      indexed images.  Each indexed image has its own private indexed
      palette, defining the set of colors available in the image:  the
      maximum number of colors allowed in an indexed palette is 256.
      These palettes are called "indexed" because each color is
      associated with an index number.  (Actually, the colors in
      ordinary palettes are numbered as well, but the numbers have no
      functional significance.)

    <para lang='en'>
      The colormap of an indexed image is shown in the <link
      linkend='gimp-indexed-palette-dialog'>Indexed Palette
      dialog</link>, which should not be confused with the Palettes
      dialog.  The Palettes dialog shows a list of all of the palettes
      available; the Indexed Palette dialog shows the colormap of the
      currently active image, if it is an indexed image---otherwise it
      shows nothing.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      You can, however, create an ordinary palette from the colors in
      an indexed image---actually from the colors in any image.  To do
      this, choose "Import Palette" from the right-click popup menu in
      the Palettes dialog:  this pops up a dialog that gives you
      several options, including the option to import the palette from
      an image.  (You can also import any of GIMP's gradients as a
      palette.)  This possibility becomes important if you want to
      create a set of indexed images that all use the same set of
      colors. 
    </para> 

    <para lang='en'>
      When you convert an image into indexed mode, a major part of the
      process is the creation of an indexed palette for the image.
      How this happens is described in detail in ??.  Briefly, you
      have several methods to choose from, one of which is to use a
      specified palette from the Palettes dialog.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Thus, to sum up the foregoing, ordinary palettes can be turned
      into indexed palettes when you convert an image into indexed
      mode; indexed palettes can be turned into ordinary palettes by
      importing them into the Palettes dialog.
