      All right, okay: you're stuck. You're trying to use one of the tools on
      an image, and nothing is happening, and nothing you try makes any
      difference. Your fists are starting to clench, and your face is starting
      to feel warm. Are you going to have to kill the program, and lose all
      your work? This sucks!

      Well, hold on a second. This happens pretty frequently, even to people
      who've used <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for a long time, but generally the
      cause is not so hard to figure out and fix if you know where to look.
      Let's be calm, and go through a checklist that will probably get you
      GIMPing happily again.
