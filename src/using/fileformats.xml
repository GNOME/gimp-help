  <para>
    The Gimp is capable of reading and writing a large variety of
    graphics file formats.   With the exception of Gimp's native XCF
    file type, file handling is done by plug-ins.  Thus, it is
    relatively easy to extend Gimp to new file types when the need
    arises. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Not all file types are equally good for all purposes.  This part
    of the documentation should help you understand the advantages and
    disadvantages of each type.

      When you open a file, using the File menu or any other method,
      Gimp needs to determine what type of file it is.  Unless there
      is no alternative, Gimp does not simply rely on the extension
      (such as ".jpg") to determine the file type, because extensions
      are not reliable:  they vary from system to system; any file can
      be renamed to have any extension; and there are many reasons why
      a file name might lack an extension.  Instead, Gimp first tries
      to recognize a file by examining its contents:  most of the
      commonly used graphics file formats have "magic headers" that
      permit them to be recognized.  Only if the magic yields no
      result does Gimp resort to using the extension.

    <para>
      There is no file format, with the exception of Gimp's native <link
      linkend="gimp-xcf-save">XCF</link> format, that is capable of
      storing all the data in a Gimp image.  When you ask to save an
      image in a format that will not completely represent it, Gimp
      notifies you of this, tells you what kind of information will be
      lost, and asks you whether you would like to "export" the image in
      a form that the file type can handle.  Exporting an image does not
      modify the image itself, so you do not lose anything by doing
      this.
    </para>
    <note>
      When you close an image (possibly by
      quitting Gimp), you are warned if the image is "dirty"; that is,
      if it has been changed without subsequently being saved.  Saving
      an image in any file format will cause the image to be
      considered "not dirty", even if the file format does not
      represent all of the information from the image.
