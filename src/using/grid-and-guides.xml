  <title>Rendering a Grid</title>
  <para>
    How can you create a grid that is actually part of the image? You can't do
    this using the image grid: that is only an aid, and is only visible on the
    monitor or in a screenshot. You can, however, use the
    <link linkend="plug-in-grid">Grid</link>
    plugin to render a grid very similar to the image grid. (Actually, the
    plugin has substantially more options.)
