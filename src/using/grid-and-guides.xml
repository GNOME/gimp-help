      You will probably have it happen many times that you need to
      place something in an image very precisely, and find that it is
      not easy to do using a mouse.  Often you can get better results by
      using the arrow keys on the keyboard (which move the affected
      object one pixel at a time, or 25 pixels if you hold down the
      Shift key), but GIMP also provides you with two other aids to make
      positioning easier:  grids and guides. 
    </para>
  
    <para lang='en'>
      Each image has a grid.  It is always present, but by default it is
      not visible until you activate it by toggling
        <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Show Grid</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      in the image menu.  If you want grids to be present more often
      than not, you can change the default behavior by checking "Show
      grid" in the <link
      linkend='gimp-prefs-image-window-appearance'>Image Window
      Appearance</link> page of the Preferences dialog.  (Note that
      there are separate settings for Normal Mode and Fullscreen Mode.) 
    </para>
  
    <para lang='en'>
      The default grid appearance, set up when you install GIMP,
      consists of plus-shaped black crosshairs at the grid line
      intersections, with grid lines spaced every 10 pixels both
      vertically and horizontally.  You can customize the default grid
      using the <link linkend='gimp-prefs-default-grid'>Default Image
      Grid</link> page of the Preferences dialog.  If you only want to
      change the grid appearance for the current image, you can do so by
      choosing 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Image</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Configure Grid</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      from the image menu:  this brings up the <link
      linkend='gimp-configure-grid-dialog'>Configure Grid</link> dialog.

      Only rectangular Cartesian grids are provided.  You can choose the
      color of the grid lines, and the spacing and offsets from the
      image origin, independently for horizontal and vertical grid
      lines.  You have a choice of five grid styles:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara lang='en'>
          <title>Intersections (dots)</title>
          This style, the least obtrusive, shows a simple dot at each
          intersection of grid lines.
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara lang='en'>
          <title>Intersections (crosshairs)</title>
          This style, the default, shows a plus-shaped crosshair at each
          intersection of grid lines.
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara lang='en'>
          <title>Dashed</title>
          This style shows dashed lines in the designated foreground
          color.  It probably won't look good if the grid line spacing
          is small.
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara lang='en'>
          <title>Double dashed</title>
          This style shows dashed lines alternating the designated
          foreground and background colors.
        </formalpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <formalpara lang='en'>
          <title>Solid</title>
          This style shows solid grid lines in the designated foreground
          color.

      Not only can a grid be helpful for judging distances and spatial
      relationships, it can also permit you to align things exactly with
      the grid, if you toggle 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Snap to Grid</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      in the image menu:  this causes the pointer to "warp" perfectly to
      any grid line located within a certain distance.  You can
      customize the snap distance threshold by setting "Snap distance"
      in the <link linkend='gimp-prefs-tool-options'>Tool Options</link>
      page of the Preferences dialog, but most people seem to be happy
      with the default value of 8 pixels.  (Note that it is perfectly
      possible to snap to the grid even if the grid is not visible.  It
      isn't easy to imagine why you might want to do this, though.)

    <title lang='en'>Guides</title>

      <mediaobject lang="en">

            fileref='../images/using/wilber-simple-guides.png'

        </para>
      </caption>
    </informalfigure>

    <para lang='en'>
      In addition to the image grid, GIMP also gives you a more
      flexible type of positioning aid: <emphasis>guides</emphasis>.
      These are horizontal or vertical lines that you create by
      clicking on one of the rulers and dragging into the image.  You
      can create as many guides as you like, positioned whereever you
      like.  To move a guide after you have created it, activate the
      Move tool in the Toolbox (or press the <keycap>M</keycap> key);
      hold down the Shift key; you can then click and drag a guide.
      To delete a guide, simply drag it outside the image.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      As with the grid, you can cause the pointer to snap to nearby
      guides, by toggling
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Snap to Guides</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      in the image menu.  If you have a number of guides and they are
      making it difficult for you to judge the image properly, you can
      hide them by toggling
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Show Guides</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
      It is suggested that you only do this momentarily, otherwise you
      may get confused the next time you try to create a guide and
      don't see anything happening.  
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      If it makes things easier for you, you can change the default
      behavior for guides in the <link
      linkend='gimp-prefs-image-window-appearance'>Image Window
      Appearance</link> page of the Preferences dialog.  Disabling
      "Show guides" is probably a bad idea, though, for the reason
      just given.
    </para>

    <note lang='en'>
      Another use for guides:  the <link
      linkend='plug-in-guillotine'>Guillotine</link> plugin can use
      guides to slice an image into a set of sub-images.

    <title lang='en'>Rendering a Grid</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      What if you want to create a grid that is actually part of the
      image?   You can't do this using the image grid:  it is only an
      aid, and only visible on the monitor or in a screenshot.  You can,
      however, use the <link linkend='plug-in-grid'>Grid</link> plugin to
      render a grid very similar to the image grid (actually the plugin
      has substantially more options).
