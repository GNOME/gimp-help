        Activate QuickMask mode using the left-bottom button in the image

        content of the selection.

        Choose any drawing tool. Paint on the QuickMask with black to
        remove selected areas, and paint with white to add selected
        areas. Use grey colors to partially select areas.

        You can also use selection tools and fill these selections with the
        Bucket Fill tool; this does not destroy the QuickMask selections!

        Toggle QuickMask mode off using the left-bottom button in the image
