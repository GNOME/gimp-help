    <para lang="en">
      Most often, you start Gimp either by clicking on an icon (if your
      system is set up to provide you with one), or by typing "gimp" on
      a command line.  If you have multiple versions of the Gimp
      installed, you may need to type "gimp-2.0" to get the latest
      version. You can, if you want, give a list of image files on the
      command line after the program name, and they will automatically
      be opened by Gimp as it starts.  It is also possible, though, to
      open files from within Gimp once it is running. 
    </para>
    <para>
      In most operating systems, you can set things up so that various
      types of image files are "associated" with Gimp, and cause it to
      start automatically when icons for them are double-clicked.  
    </para>
    <tip>
      If you want to cause a certain file type to automatically open in
      Gimp, you should associate it with "gimp-remote" rather than with
      "gimp".  The gimp-remote program is an auxiliary that comes with
      gimp.  If gimp is not already running on the system when
      gimp-remote is executed, it is started and the image given as
      argument to gimp-remote is loaded.  If gimp is already running,
      though, the image is simply loaded into the already-running
      program.

      Ordinarily you don't need to give any arguments when starting
      Gimp, but here is a list of some that may at one time or anther
      be useful.  This is not a complete list; on Unix systems you can
      get a complete list by running "man gimp" in a terminal window.

      The Gimp knows what it is and is proud of itself.  It is an
      image manipulation program.  At the most sweeping level, using
      Gimp involves three basic 
      steps:  (1) opening images or creating new ones; (2) altering
      those images; (3) saving the results.

            Depending on how Gimp was started, there may already be
            one or more images open when you begin.  You can open new
            images from files using the <link
            linkend='gimp-file-open'>Open</link> command from the File
            menu.  Gimp is capable of opening a large variety of
            graphics file formats; see <link
            linkend='gimp-files'>Files</link> for more information.
            Depending on how your system is set up, you may also be
            able to open images by clicking on icons in a file
            manager, or by drag-and-drop from other programs.  If you
            aren't sure whether you can do this, just try it.  The
            worst thing that can happen is that your computer could
            explode.

            Gimp provides you with an enormous number of ways of
            acting on images:  painting tools, color manipulation
            tools, transformation tools, filters, etc.  The bulk of
            this manual is devoted to describing these tools and how
            to work with them.

	<term lang="en">Saving Images</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para lang="en">
            When you are finished working with an image, you will want
            to save the results.  (In fact, it is often a good idea to
            save at intermediate stages too:  Gimp is a pretty robust
            program, but we have heard rumors, possibly apocryphal,
            that it may have been known on rare and mysterious
            occasions to crash.)  Most of the file formats that Gimp
            can open, can also be used for saving.  There is one file
            format that is special, though:  XCF is Gimp's native
            format, and is useful because it stores
            <emphasis>everything</emphasis> about an image (well,
            almost everything; it does not store "undo" information).
            Thus, the XCF format is especially suitable for saving
            intermediate results, and for saving images to be
            re-opened later in Gimp.  XCF files are not readable by
            most other programs that display images, so once you have
            finished, you will probably also want to save the image in
            a more widely used format, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.
