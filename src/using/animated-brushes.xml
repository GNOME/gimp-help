  <para>
    When your new animated brush is created, it is displayed within the image
    window and you would like save it into a gih format. You select
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>Save as...</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    menu, name your work with the gih extension in the new window relevant
    field and as soon as you pressed the Save button, the following window is
    displayed:

  <para>
    This dialog box has several options not easy to understand. They allow you
    to determine the way your brush is animated.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Spacing (Percent)</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <quote>Spacing</quote> is the distance between consecutive brush
          marks when you trace out a brushstroke with the pointer. You must
          consider drawing with a brush, whatever the paint tool, like
          stamping. If Spacing is low, stamps will be very close and stroke
          look continuous. If spacing is high, stamps will be separated:
          that's interesting with a color brush (like <quote>green
          pepper</quote> for instance). Value varies from 1 to 200 and this
          percentage refers to brush <quote>diameter</quote>: 100% is one
          diameter.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Description</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          It's the brush name that will appear at the top of Brush Dialog
          (grid mode) when the brush is selected.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Cell Size</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          That's size of cells you will cut up in layers... Default is one
          cell per layer and size is that of the layer. Then there is only
          one brush aspect per layer.
        </para>
        <para>
          We could have only one big layer and cut up in it the cells that
          will be used for the different aspects of the animated brush.
        </para>
        <para>
          For instance, we want a 100x100 pixels brush with 8 different
          aspects. We can take these 8 aspects from a 400x200 pixels layer,
          or from a 300x300 pixels layer but with one cell unused.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Number of cells</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          That's the number of cells (one cell per aspect) that will be cut
          in every layer. Default is the number of layers as there is only
          one layer per aspect.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Display as</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          This tells how cells have been arranged in layers. If, for example,
          you have placed height cells at the rate of two cells per layer on
          four layers, GIMP will display:
          <computeroutput>1 rows of 2 columns on each layer</computeroutput>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Dimension, Ranks, Selection</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          There things are getting complicated! Explanations are necessary to
          understand how to arrange cell and layers.
        </para>
        <para>
          GIMP starts retrieving cells from each layer and stacks them into a
          FIFO stack (First In First Out: the first in is at the top of the
          stack and so can be first out). In our example 4 layers with 2 cells
          in each, we'll have, from top to bottom: first cell of first layer,
          second cell of first layer, first cell of second layer, second cell
          of second layer..., second cell of fourth layer. With one cell per
          layer or with several cells per layer, result is the same. You can
          see this stack in the Layer Dialog of the resulting
          <filename class="extension">.gih</filename> image file.
        </para>
        <para>
          Then GIMP creates a computer array from this stack with the
          <guilabel>Dimensions</guilabel>
          you have set. You can use four dimensions.
        </para>
        <para>
          In computer science an array has a <quote>myarray(x,y,z)</quote>
          form for a 3 dimensions array (3D). It's easy to imagine a 2D array:
          on a paper it's an array with rows and columns
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/using/gih-array2D.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
          With a 3d array we don't talk rows and columns but
          <guilabel>Dimensions</guilabel> and
          <guilabel>Ranks</guilabel>.
          The first dimension is along x axis, the second dimension along y
          axis, the third along z axis. Each dimension has ranks of cells.
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/using/gih-array3D.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
          To fill up this array, GIMP starts retrieving cells from the top of
          stack. The way it fills the array reminds that of an odometer: right
          rank digits turn first and, when they reach their maximum, left rank
          digits start running. If you have some memories of Basic programming
          you will have, with an array(4,2,2), the following succession:
          (1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,2,2),(3,1,1)....
          (4,2,2). We will see this later in an example.
        </para>
        <para>
          Besides the rank number that you can give to each dimension, you can
          also give them a <guilabel>Selection</guilabel> mode. You have
          several modes that will be applied when drawing:

              </para>
              <para>
                The first rank is for the direction 0°, upwards. The other
                ranks are affected, clockwise, to an angle whose value
                is 360/number of ranks. So, with 4 ranks in the concerned
                dimension, the angle will move 90° clockwise for each
                direction change: second rank will be affected to 90°
                (rightwards), third rank to 180° (downwards) and fourth rank to
                270° (-90°) (leftwards).<footnote><para>

          Well! What is all this useful for? We'll see that gradually with
          examples. You can actually place in each dimension cases that will
          give your brush a particular action.

      <term>A 3 dimensions image hose</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          We are now going to create a 3D animated brush: its orientation will
          vary according to brush direction, it will alternate Left/Right
          hands regularly and its color will vary at random between black and
          blue.
        </para>
        <para>
          The first question we have to answer to is the number of images that
          is necessary. We reserve the first dimension (x) to the brush
          direction (4 directions). The second dimension (y) is for Left/Right
          alternation and the third dimension (z) for color variation. Such a
          brush is represented in a 3D array <quote>myarray(4,2,2)</quote>:
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
          There are 4 ranks in first dimension (x), 2 ranks in second
          dimension (y) and 2 ranks in third dimension (z). We see that there
          are 4x2x2 = 16 cells. We need 16 images.

            <para>
              Duplicate the layer. Let visible only the duplicated layer,
              select it and apply a 90° rotation (Layer/Transform/ 90°
              rotation clockwise). Rename it to handL90k.

            <para>
              Repeat the same operations to create handL180k and handL-90k (or

              This dimension in our example has two ranks, one for left hand
              and the other for right hand. The left hand rank exists yet. We
              shall build right hand images by flipping it horizontally.
            </para>
            <para>
              Duplicate the handL0k layer. Let it visible only and select it.
              Rename it to handR0K. Apply Layer/Transform/Flip Horizontally.
            </para>
            <para>
              Repeat the same operation on the other left hand layers to
              create their right hand equivalent.
            </para>
            <para>
              Re-order layers to have a clockwise rotation from top to
              bottom, alternating Left and Right: handL0k, handR0k, handL90k,
              handR90k, ..., handR-90k.

            <para>
              <emphasis>Creating images of dimension 3 (z)</emphasis>:
              The third dimension has two ranks, one for black color and the
              other for blue color. The first rank, black, exists yet. We well
              see that images of dimension 3 will be a copy, in blue, of the
              images of dimension 2. So we will have our 16 images. But a row
              of 16 layers is not easy to manage: we will use layers with two
              images.
            </para>
            <para>
              Select the handL0k layer and let it visible only. Using
              Image/Canvas Size change canvas size to 60x30 pixels.
            </para>
            <para>
              Duplicate hand0k layer. On the copy, fill the hand with blue
              using Bucket Fill tool.
            </para>
            <para>
              Now, select the Move tool. Double click on it to accede to its
              properties: check <guilabel>Move the Current Layer</guilabel>
              option. Move the blue hand into the right part of the layer
              precisely with the help of <guisubmenu>Zoom</guisubmenu>.
            </para>
            <para>
              Make sure only handL0k and its blue copy are visible. Right
              click on the Layer Dialog: Apply the <guimenuitem>Merge Visible
              Layers</guimenuitem> command with the option <guilabel>Expand as
              Necessary</guilabel>. You get a 60x30 pixels layer with the
              black hand on the left and the blue hand on the right. Rename it
              to <quote>handsL0</quote>.
            </para>
            <para>
              Repeat the same operations on the other layers.

            <title>Set layers in order</title>
            <para>
              Layers must be set in
              order so that GIMP can find the required image at some point
              of using the brush. Our layers are yet in order but we must
              understand more generally how to have them in order.There are
              two ways to imagine this setting in order. The first method is
              mathematical: GIMP divides the 16 layers first by 4; that gives
              4 groups of 4 layers for the first dimension. Each group
              represents a direction of the brush. Then, it divides each group
              by 2; that gives 8 groups of 2 layers for the second dimension:
              each group represents a L/R alternation. Then another division
              by 2 for the third dimension to represent a color at random
              between black and blue.
            </para>
            <para>
              The other method is visual, by using the array representation.
              Correlation between two methods is represented in next image:
              <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                  <imagedata format="PNG"
                    fileref="images/using/gih-correlation.png"/>
                </imageobject>
              </mediaobject>
            </para>
            <para>
              <emphasis>How will GIMP read this array?</emphasis>: GIMP
              starts with the first dimension which is programmed for
              <quote>angular</quote>, for instance 90°. In this 90°
              rank, in yellow, in the second dimension, it selects a L/R
              alternation, in an <quote>incremental</quote> way. Then,
              in the third dimension, in a random way, it chooses a color.
              Finally, our layers must be in the following order:
              <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                  <imagedata format="PNG"
                    fileref="images/using/gih-hands-layers.png"/>
                </imageobject>
              </mediaobject>
            </para>
          </step>
          <step>

              Voilà. Your brush is ready. Save it as
