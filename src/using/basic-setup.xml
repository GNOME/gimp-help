      The screenshot above shows the most basic arrangement of Gimp
      windows that can be used effectively.  (It is similar to the
      setup you get when you start Gimp for the first time, after
      freshly installing it, except a little simpler.)  Three windows
      are shown:

        <term lang='en'>The Main Toolbox</term>
        <listitem>
          <para lang='en'>
            This is the heart of the Gimp.  It contains the highest
            level menu, plus a set of icon buttons that can be used to
            select tool, and more.  Docked below the main Toolbox is a
            Tool Options dialog, showing options for the currently
            selected tool (in this case, the Rectangle Select tool).

          <para lang='en'>
            This dialog window shows the layer structure of the
            currently active image, and allows it to be manipulated
            in a variety of ways.  It is possible to do a few very
            basic things without using the Layers dialog, but even
            moderately sophisticated Gimp users find it
            indispensible to have the Layers dialog available at all
            times.

        <listitem>
          <para lang='en'>
            Each image open in Gimp is displayed in a separate window.
            Many images can be open at the same time: the limit is set
            only by the amount of system resources.  It is possible to
            run Gimp without having any images open, but there are not
            very many useful things to do then.

      This is a minimal setup.  There are over a dozen other types of
      dialogs used by Gimp for various purposes, but users typically
      create them when they are needed and close them when they are
      not.  Knowledgeable users generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool
      Options) and Layers dialog around at all times.  The Toolbox is
      essential to many Gimp operations; in fact, if you close it,
      Gimp will exit.  (You are asked to confirm that you want to do
      this, though.)  The Tool Options are actually a separate dialog,
      shown docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot.
      Knowledgeable users almost always have them set up this way: it
      is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to
      see how their options are set.  The Layers dialog comes into
      play whenever you work with an image that has multiple layers:
      once you advance beyond the very most basic stages of Gimp
      expertise, this means <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>.  And
      finally, of course, the necessity of having images displayed in
      order to work with them is perhaps obvious.

      If your Gimp layout gets trashed, fortunately the arrangement
      shown in the screenshot is pretty easy to recover.  In the
      <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu from the Main Toolbox, selecting 
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Dialogs</guisubmenu>
        <guisubmenu>Create New Dock</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem>Layers, Channels, and Paths</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      will give you a Layers dialog just like the one shown.  In the
      same menu, selecting
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Dialogs</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem>Tool Options</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      gives you a new Tool Options dialog, which you can then dock
      below the Main Toolbox.  (The section <link
      linkend='gimp-using-docks'>Using Docks</link> explains how to
      dock dialogs.)  There is no need to be able to create a new Main
      Toolbox, because you cannot get rid of the one you have without
      causing Gimp to exit.

      Unlike some other programs, Gimp does not give you the options
      of putting everything---controls and image displays---all into a
      single comprehensive window.  The Gimp developers have always
      felt that this is a poor way of working, because it forces the
      program to perform a wide range of functions that are much
      better done by a dedicated window manager.  Not only would this
      waste a lot of programmer time, it is almost impossible to do in
      a way that works correctly across all of the operating systems
      Gimp is intended to run on.

      Earlier versions of the Gimp (up to Gimp 1.2.5) were very
      profligate with dialogs:  advanced users often had half a dozen
      or more dialogs open at once, scattered all over the screen and
      very difficult to keep track of.  Gimp 2.0 is much better in
      this respect, because it allows dialogs to be docked together in
      a flexible way.  (The Layers dialog in the screenshot actually
      contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels,
      Paths, and Undo.)  The system takes a little while to learn, but
      once you learn it, we hope that you will like it.

      The following sections will walk you through the components of
      each of the windows shown in the screenshot, explaining what
      they are and how they work.  Once you have read them, plus the
      section describing the basic structure of Gimp images, you
      should have learned enough to use Gimp for a wide variety of
      basic image manipulations.  You can then look through the rest
      of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the
      almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things
      that are possible.  Have fun!
