      I am exporting to a jpeg image and my transparent area turned white or black

      When exporting images, you need to be aware that most image formats have
      limitations. A limitation of jpeg images is, that it does not support
      transparency. When exporting to jpeg, GIMP fills the transparent areas
      with the background color, which by default is white.

    <para>
      To fix this, you will have to choose a different image format that does
      support transparency, such as png or tiff.

      I am exporting to a gif image and the colors changed
    </title>
    <para>
      When exporting images, you need to be aware that most image formats have
      limitations. A limitation of gif images is, that it supports a maximum
      of 256 colors. For animated gif, this is 256 colors per frame; however,
      GIMP does not support exporting each frame with a different set of 256
      colors. When exporting to gif, GIMP reduces the number of colors in your
      image to 256 by combining more or less similar colors together. This can
      cause noticeable changes in your image.

    <para>
      To fix this, you will have to choose a different image format that does
      support more colors; or convert your image to
      <link linkend="gimp-image-convert-indexed">Indexed Mode</link> and
      manually adjust any colors before exporting to gif.
