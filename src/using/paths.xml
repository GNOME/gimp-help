    Paths are curves (known as Bézier-curves). In <acronym>GIMP</acronym> it's
    very easy to learn and to use them. To understand their concepts and
    mechanism you can go to the glossary
    <link linkend="glossary-bezier-curve">Bézier-curve</link> or to Wikipedia
    <xref linkend="bibliography-online-wkpd-bezier"/>.
    It is a very powerful tool to design sophisticated forms. To use it in
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> you must operate by two successive ways: 1st
    Create the path and 2nd Stroke path.
  </para>
  <para>
    According to the terminology used in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>,
    <quote>Stroke path</quote> means here to apply a specific style to the
    path (color, width, pattern... ).

      At this step you can design a skeleton of wished form; this skeleton
      will be modified later by various ways. To do this you can go to

      Your pointer changes into a pen feature with a curve beginning; if you
      left-click in the image you print a point (white inner circle with a
      black border); moving mouse and left-clicking again you create
      automatically a second point linked to previous one. You can carry on as
      often as you wish it to design a polyline, but to learn you need two
      points only. Now if you approach pointer close to segment ranging
      between the two points, the little <quote>+</quote>
      close to pointer changes into a cross (for moving). Now press down left
      button moving pointer to any side.
    </para>
    <para>
      Then two events occur. One is a bending of the segment to the moving
      direction and this bending is proportional to displacement. The
      second reveals two segments ended with squares (named handles) at the
      two curve ends . If you place the mouse pointer on these squares it
      changes into a pointing finger. Now, if you click-and-drag you can see
      the consequence on the curve feature. By this mean you can change the
      starting curve orientation as well as its <quote>lengthening</quote>
      on modified side.

    <para>
      Paths can be created and manipulated using the
      <link linkend="gimp-tool-path">Path tool</link>.
      The image above shows a path which consists of two components, having
      both straight and curved segments, being worked on with the Path tool.
      Black squares are anchor points, the open circle indicates the selected
      anchor and the two open squares are the two handles which are associated
      with this anchor from the curves on either side of it.
    </para>

    <para>
      Paths, like layers and channels, are components of an image. When an
      image is saved in GIMP's native XCF file format, any paths it has are
      saved along with it. The list of paths in an image can be viewed and
      operated on using the
      <link linkend="gimp-path-dialog">Paths dialog</link>.
      If you want to move a path from one image to another, you can do so by
      copying and pasting using the pop-up menu in the Paths dialog, or by
      dragging an icon from the Paths dialog into the destination image's
      window.
    </para>
    <para>
      GIMP paths belong to a mathematical type called
      <quote>Bezier paths</quote>. What this means in practical terms is that
      they are defined by <emphasis>anchors</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>handles</emphasis>. <quote>Anchors</quote> are points the path
      goes through. <quote>Handles</quote> define the direction of a path when
      it enters or leaves an anchor point: each anchor point has two handles
      attached to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Paths can be very complex. If you create them by hand using the Path
      tool, unless you are obsessive they probably won't contain more than a
      few dozen anchor points (often many fewer); but if you create them by
      transforming a selection into a path, or by transforming text into a
      path, the result can easily contain hundreds of anchor points, or even
      thousands.
    </para>
    <para>
      A path may contain multiple <emphasis>components</emphasis>. A
      <quote>component</quote>
      is a part of a path whose anchor points are all connected to each other
      by path segments. The ability to have multiple components in paths
      allows you to convert them into selections having multiple disconnected
      parts.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each component of a path can be either <emphasis>open</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>closed</emphasis>: <quote>closed</quote>
      means that the last anchor point is connected to the first anchor point.
      If you transform a path into a selection, any open components are
      automatically converted into closed components by connecting the last
      anchor point to the first anchor point with a straight line.
    </para>
    <para>
      Path segments can be either straight or curved. A path all of whose
      segments are straight is called <quote>polygonal</quote>.
      When you create a path segment, it starts out straight, because the
      handles for the anchor points are initially placed directly on top of
      the anchor points, yielding handles of zero length, which produce
      straight-line segments. You can make a segment curved by dragging a
      handle away from one of the anchor points.
    </para>
    <para>
      One nice thing about paths is that they are very light in terms of
      resource consumption, especially in comparison with images. Representing
      a path in RAM only requires storing the coordinates of its anchors and
      handles: 1K of memory is enough to hold quite a complex path, but not
      enough to hold even a 20x20 pixel RGB layer. Therefore, it is quite
      possible to have literally hundreds of paths in an image without putting
      any significant stress of your system. (How much stress managing them
      would put on <emphasis>you</emphasis>
      is, of course, another question.) Even a path with thousands of segments
      consumes minimal resources in comparison to a typical layer or channel.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-and-selections">
    <title>Paths and Selections</title>
    <para>
      GIMP lets you transform the selection for an image into a path; it also
      lets you transform paths into selections. For information about the
      selection and how it works, see the
      <link linkend="gimp-concepts-selection">Selection</link> section.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you transform a selection into a path, the path closely follows the
      <quote>marching ants</quote>.
      Now, the selection is a two-dimensional entity, but a path is a
      one-dimensional entity, so there is no way to transform the selection
      into a path without losing information. In fact, any information about
      partially selected areas (i.e., feathering) will be lost when the
      selection is turned into a path. If the path is transformed back into a
      selection, the result is an all-or-none selection, similar to what would
      be obtained by executing "Sharpen" from the Select menu.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-transforming">
    <title>Transforming Paths</title>
    <para>
      Each of the Transform tools (Rotate, Scale, Perspective, etc) can be set
      to act specifically on paths, using the <quote>Affect:</quote> option
      in the tool's Tool Options dialog. This gives you a powerful set of
      methods for altering the shapes of paths without affecting other
      elements of the image.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default a Transform tool, when it is set to affect paths, only acts
      on a single path: the <emphasis>active path</emphasis>
      for the image, which is shown highlighted in the Paths dialog. You can
      make a transformation affect more than one path, and possibly other
      things as well, using the <quote>transform lock</quote> buttons in the
      Paths dialog.
      Not only paths, but also layers and channels, can be transform-locked.
      If you transform one element that is transform-locked, all others will
      be transformed in the same way. So, for example, if you want to scale a
      layer and a path by the same amount, click the transform-lock buttons
      so that <quote>chain</quote> symbols appear next to the layer in the
      Layers dialog, and the path in the Paths dialog; then use the Scale
      tool on either the layer or the path, and the other will automatically
      follow.

          More importantly, transforming the text. Converting text into a
          path, then transforming the path, and finally either stroking the
          path or converting it to a selection and filling it, often leads to
          much higher-quality results than rendering the text as a layer and
          transforming the pixel data.

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-and-svg">
    <title>Paths and <acronym>SVG</acronym> files</title>
    <para>
      <acronym>SVG</acronym>, standing for <quote>Scalable Vector
      Graphics</quote>, is an increasingly popular file format for
      <emphasis>vector graphics</emphasis>, in which graphical elements are
      represented in a resolution-independent format, in contrast to
      <emphasis>raster graphics</emphasis>; in which graphical elements are
      represented as arrays of pixels. GIMP is mainly a raster graphics
      program, but paths are vector entities.
    </para>
    <para>
      Fortunately, paths are represented in <acronym>SVG</acronym> files in
      almost exactly the same way they are represented in GIMP.  (Actually
      fortune has nothing to do with it: GIMP's path handling was rewritten
      for GIMP 2.0 with SVG paths in mind.) This compatibility makes it
      possible to store GIMP paths as <acronym>SVG</acronym> files without
      losing any information. You can access this capability in the Paths
      dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      It also means that GIMP can create paths from
      <acronym>SVG</acronym> files saved in other programs, such as
      <application>Inkscape</application> or
      <application>Sodipodi</application>,
      two popular open-source vector graphics applications. This is nice
      because those programs have much more powerful path-manipulation tools
      than GIMP does. You can import a path from an <acronym>SVG</acronym>
      file using the Paths dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <acronym>SVG</acronym>
      format handles many other graphical elements than just paths: among
      other things, it handles figures such as squares, rectangles, circles,
      ellipses, regular polygons, etc. GIMP cannot do anything with these
      entities, but it can load them as paths.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Creating paths is not the only thing GIMP can do with
        <acronym>SVG</acronym> files. It can also open
        <acronym>SVG</acronym> files as GIMP images, in the usual way.
