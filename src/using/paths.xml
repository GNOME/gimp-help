    Paths are curves (known as Bézier-curves). Paths are easy to learn and use
    in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. To understand their concepts and
    mechanism, look at the glossary
    <link linkend="glossary-bezier-curve">Bézier-curve</link> or Wikipedia
    <xref linkend="bibliography-online-wkpd-bezier"/>.
    The Paths tool is very powerful, allowing you to design sophisticated
    forms. To use the Paths tool in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you must first
    create a path, and then stroke the path.
  </para>

    In <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, the term <quote>Stroke path</quote> means to
    apply a specific style to the path (color, width, pattern... ).

      When the Paths tool is selected, the mouse cursor
      changes into a pointer (arrow) with a curve.
      Left click in the image to create the first point on the path. Move
      the mouse to a new point and left click the mouse to create another
      point linked to the previous point. Although you can create as many
      points as you desire, you only need two points to learn about Paths.
      While adding points, the mouse cursor has a little <quote>+</quote>
      next to the curve, which indicates that clicking will add a new
      point. When the mouse cursor is close to a line segment, the
      <quote>+</quote> changes into a cross with arrows; like the move tool.

      The path is comprised of two components with both straight and curved

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-properties">
    <title>Path Properties</title>
    <para>
      Paths, like layers and channels, are components of an image. When an
      image is saved in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s native XCF file format, any
      paths it has are saved with it. The list of paths in an image can be
      viewed and operated on using the
      <link linkend="gimp-path-dialog">Paths dialog</link>.
      You can move a path from one image to another by copying and pasting
      using the pop-up menu in the Paths dialog, or by dragging an icon from
      the Paths dialog into the destination image window.
    </para>
    <para>
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> paths belong to a mathematical type called
      <quote>Bezier paths</quote>. What this means in practical terms is that
      they are defined by <emphasis>anchors</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>handles</emphasis>. <quote>Anchors</quote> are points the path
      goes through. <quote>Handles</quote> define the direction of a path when
      it enters or leaves an anchor point: each anchor point has two handles
      attached to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Paths can be very complex. If you create them by hand using the Path
      tool, unless you are obsessive they probably won't contain more than a
      few dozen anchor points (often many fewer); but if you create them by
      transforming a selection into a path, or by transforming text into a
      path, the result can easily contain hundreds of anchor points, or even
      thousands.
    </para>
    <para>
      A path may contain multiple <emphasis>components</emphasis>. A
      <quote>component</quote>
      is a part of a path whose anchor points are all connected to each other
      by path segments. The ability to have multiple components in paths
      allows you to convert them into selections having multiple disconnected
      parts.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each component of a path can be either <emphasis>open</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>closed</emphasis>: <quote>closed</quote>
      means that the last anchor point is connected to the first anchor point.
      If you transform a path into a selection, any open components are
      automatically converted into closed components by connecting the last
      anchor point to the first anchor point with a straight line.
    </para>
    <para>
      Path segments can be either straight or curved. A path is called
      <quote>polygonal</quote> if all of its segments are straight.
      A new path segment is always created straight; the handles for the
      anchor points are directly on top of the anchor points, yielding
      handles of zero length, which produces straight-line segments.
      Drag a handle handle away from an anchor point to cause a segment
      to curve.
    </para>
    <para>
      One nice thing about paths is that they use very few resources,
      especially in comparison with images. Representing
      a path in RAM requires storing only the coordinates of its anchors and
      handles: 1K of memory is enough to hold a complex path, but not
      enough to hold a small 20x20 pixel RGB layer. Therefore, it is
      possible to have literally hundreds of paths in an image without causing
      any significant stress to your system; the amount of stress that
      hundreds of paths might cause <emphasis>you</emphasis>, however, 
      is another question. Even a path with thousands of segments
      consumes minimal resources in comparison to a typical layer or channel.

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-and-selections">
    <title>Paths and Selections</title>
    <para>
      GIMP lets you transform the selection for an image into a path; it also
      lets you transform paths into selections. For information about the
      selection and how it works, see the
      <link linkend="gimp-concepts-selection">Selection</link> section.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you transform a selection into a path, the path closely follows the
      <quote>marching ants</quote>.
      Now, the selection is a two-dimensional entity, but a path is a
      one-dimensional entity, so there is no way to transform the selection
      into a path without losing information. In fact, any information about
      partially selected areas (i.e., feathering) are lost when a
      selection is turned into a path. If the path is transformed back into a
      selection, the result is an all-or-none selection, similar to what is
      obtained by executing "Sharpen" from the Select menu.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-paths-transforming">
    <title>Transforming Paths</title>
    <para>
      Each of the Transform tools (Rotate, Scale, Perspective, etc) can be set
      to act on a layer, selection, or path. Select the transform tool in the
      toolbox, then select layer, selection, or path for the
      <quote>Transform:</quote> option in the tool's Tool Options
      dialog. This gives you a powerful set of
      methods for altering the shapes of paths without affecting other
      elements of the image.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default a Transform tool, when it is set to affect paths, acts on
      only one path: the <emphasis>active path</emphasis>
      for the image, which is shown highlighted in the Paths dialog. You can
      make a transformation affect more than one path, and possibly other
      things as well, using the <quote>transform lock</quote> buttons in the
      Paths dialog.
      Not only paths, but also layers and channels, can be transform-locked.
      If you transform one element that is transform-locked, all others will
      be transformed in the same way. So, for example, if you want to scale a
      layer and a path by the same amount, click the transform-lock buttons
      so that <quote>chain</quote> symbols appear next to the layer in the
      Layers dialog, and the path in the Paths dialog; then use the Scale
      tool on either the layer or the path, and the other will automatically
      follow.

    <title>Paths and <acronym>SVG</acronym> files</title>
    <para>
      <acronym>SVG</acronym>, standing for <quote>Scalable Vector
      Graphics</quote>, is an increasingly popular file format for
      <emphasis>vector graphics</emphasis>, in which graphical elements are
      represented in a resolution-independent format, in contrast to
      <emphasis>raster graphics</emphasis>; in which graphical elements are
      represented as arrays of pixels. GIMP is mainly a raster graphics
      program, but paths are vector entities.
    </para>
    <para>
      Fortunately, paths are represented in <acronym>SVG</acronym> files in
      almost exactly the same way they are represented in GIMP.  (Actually
      fortune has nothing to do with it: GIMP's path handling was rewritten
      for GIMP 2.0 with SVG paths in mind.) This compatibility makes it
      possible to store GIMP paths as <acronym>SVG</acronym> files without
      losing any information. You can access this capability in the Paths
      dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      It also means that GIMP can create paths from
      <acronym>SVG</acronym> files saved in other programs, such as
      <application>Inkscape</application> or
      <application>Sodipodi</application>,
      two popular open-source vector graphics applications. This is nice
      because those programs have much more powerful path-manipulation tools
      than GIMP does. You can import a path from an <acronym>SVG</acronym>
      file using the Paths dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <acronym>SVG</acronym>
      format handles many other graphical elements than just paths: among
      other things, it handles figures such as squares, rectangles, circles,
      ellipses, regular polygons, etc. GIMP cannot do anything with these
      entities, but it can load them as paths.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Creating paths is not the only thing GIMP can do with
        <acronym>SVG</acronym> files. It can also open
