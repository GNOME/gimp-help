    A <emphasis>path</emphasis> is a one-dimensional curve.  Paths are
    used for two main purposes:

  <para lang='en'>
    Paths can be created and manipulated using the <link
    linkend='gimp-tool-path'>Path tool</link>.  Paths, like layers and
    channels, are components of an image.  When an image is saved in
    GIMP's native XCF file format, any paths it has are saved along
    with it.  The list of paths in an image can be viewed and operated
    on using the <link linkend='gimp-paths-dialog'>Paths
    dialog</link>.  If you want to move a path from one image to
    another, you can do so by copying and pasting using the popup menu
    in the Paths dialog, or by dragging an icon from the Paths dialog
    into the destination image's window.

         handles.  Note that this path has two components.
      </para>
    </caption>
  </informalfigure>

  <para lang='en'>
    GIMP paths belong to a mathematical type called "Bezier paths".
    What this means in practical terms is that they are defined by
    <emphasis>anchors</emphasis> and <emphasis>handles</emphasis>.
    "Anchors" are points the path goes through.  "Handles" define the
    direction of a path when it enters or leaves an anchor point:
    each anchor point has two handles attached to it.  
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    Paths can be very complex.  If you create them by hand using the
    Path tool, unless you are obsessive they probably won't contain
    more than a few dozen anchor points (often many fewer); but if you
    create them by transforming a selection into a path, or by
    transforming text into a path, the result can easily contain
    hundreds of anchor points, or even thousands.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    A path may contain multiple <emphasis>components</emphasis>.  A
    "component" is a part of a path whose anchor points are all
    connected to each other by path segments.  The ability to have
    multiple components in paths allows you to convert them into
    selections having multiple disconnected parts.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    Each component of a path can be either <emphasis>open</emphasis>
    or <emphasis>closed</emphasis>: "closed" means that the last
    anchor point is connected to the first anchor point.  If you
    transform a path into a selection, any open components are
    automatically converted into closed components by connecting the
    last anchor point to the first anchor point with a straight line.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    Path segments can be either straight or curved.  A path all of
    whose segments are straight is called "polygonal".  When you
    create a path segment, it starts out straight, because the handles
    for the anchor points are intially placed directly on top of the
    anchor points, yielding handles of zero length, which produce
    straight-line segments.  You can make a segment curved by dragging
    a handle away from one of the anchor points.
  </para>

  <para lang='en'>
    One nice thing about paths is that they are very light in terms of
    resource consumption, especially in comparison with images.
    Representing a path in RAM only requires storing the
    coordinates of its anchors and handles:  1K of memory is enough to
    hold quite a complex path, but not enough to hold even a 20x20
    pixel RGB layer.  Therefore, it is quite possible to have
    literally hundreds of paths in an image without putting any
    signficant stress of your system.  (How much stress managing them
    would put on <emphasis>you</emphasis> is, of course, another
    question.)  Even a path with thousands of segments consumes
    minimal resources in comparison to a typical layer or channel.
  </para>

    <title lang='en'>Paths and Selections</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      GIMP lets you transform the selection for an image into a path;
      it also lets you transform paths into selections.  For
      information about the selection and how it works, see the <link
      linkend='gimp-selection'>Selection</link> section.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      When you transform a selection into a path, the path closely
      follows the "marching ants".  Now, the selection is a
      two-dimensional entity, but a path is a one-dimensional entity,
      so there is no way to transform the selection into a path
      without losing information.  In fact, and information about
      partially selected areas (i.e., feathering) will be lost when
      the selection is turned into a path.  If the path is transformed
      back into a selection, the result is an all-or-none selection,
      similar to what would be obtained by executing "Sharpen" from
      the Select menu.

    <para lang='en'>
      Paths do not alter the appearance of the image pixel data unless
      they are <emphasis>stroked</emphasis>, using
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Stroke Path</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      from the image menu or the Paths dialog right-click menu, or the
      "Stroke Path" button in the Tool Options dialog for the Path
      tool.  
    </para>
    <para lang='en'>
      Choosing "Stroke Path" by any of these means brings up a dialog
      that allows you to control the way the stroking is done.  You
      can choose from a wide variety of line styles, or you can stroke
      with any of the Paint tools, including unusual ones such as the
      Clone tool, Smudge tool, Eraser, etc.
    </para>
    <para lang='en'>
      You can further increase the range of stroking effects by
      stroking a path multiple times, or lines or brushes of different
      widths.  The possibilities for getting interesting effects in
      this way are almost unlimited.

    <title lang='en'>Transforming Paths</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      Each of the Transform tools (Rotate, Scale, Perspective, etc)
      can be set to act specifically on paths, using the "Affect:"
      option in the tool's Tool Options dialog.  This gives you a
      powerful set of methods for altering the shapes of paths without
      affecting other elements of the image.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      By default a Transform tool, when it is set to affect paths,
      only acts on a single path:  the <emphasis>active
      path</emphasis> for the image, which is shown highlighted in the
      Paths dialog.  You can make a transformation affect more than
      one path, and possibly other things as well, using the
      "transform lock" buttons in the Paths dialog.  Not only paths,
      but also layers and channels, can be transform-locked.  If you
      transform one element that is transform-locked, all others will
      be transformed in the same way.  So, for example, if you want to
      scale a layer and a path by the same amount, click the
      transform-lock buttons so that "chain" symbols appear next to
      the layer in the Layers dialog, and the path in the Paths
      dialog; then use the Scale tool on either the layer or the path,
      and the other will automatically follow.

      A text item created using the Text tool can be transformed into
      a path using the "Create path from text" button in the Tool
      Options for the Text tool.  This can be useful for several
      purposes, including:

          into a path, then transforming the path, and finally either
          stroking the path or converting it to a selection and
          filling it, often leads to much higher-quality results than
          rendering the text as a layer and transforming the pixel
          data.

    <title lang='en'>Paths and SVG files</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      SVG, standing for "Scalable Vector Graphics", is an increasingly
      popular file format for <emphasis>vector graphics</emphasis>, in
      which graphical elements are represented in a
      resolution-independent format, in contrast to <emphasis>raster
      graphics</emphasis>, in which graphical elements are represented
      as arrays of pixels.  GIMP is mainly a raster graphics program,
      but paths are vector entities.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Fortunately, paths are represented in SVG files in almost
      exactly the same way they are represented in GIMP.  (Actually
      fortune has nothing to do with it:  GIMP's path handling was
      rewritten for GIMP 2.0 with SVG paths in mind.)  This
      compatibility makes it possible to store GIMP paths as SVG files
      without losing any information.   You can access this capability
      in the Paths dialog.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      It also means that GIMP can create paths from SVG files saved in
      other programs, such as <application>Inkscape</application> or
      <application>Sodipodi</application>, two popular open-source
      vector graphics applications.  This is nice because those
      programs have much more powerful path-manipulation tools than
      GIMP does.  You can import a path from an SVG file using the
      Paths dialog.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      The SVG format handles many other graphical elements than just
      paths:  among other things, it handles figures such as squares,
      rectangles, circles, ellipses, regular polygons, etc.  GIMP 2.0
      cannot do anything with these entities, but GIMP 2.2 can load
      them as paths.
    </para>

    <note lang='en'>
      Creating paths is not the only thing GIMP can do with SVG
      files.  It can also open SVG files as GIMP images, in the usual
      way.
