  <title>Creating Shortcuts to Menu Functions</title>

  <para>
    Many functions which are accessible via the image menu have a default
    keyboard shortcut. You may want to create a new shortcut for a command
    that you use a lot and doesn't have one or, more rarely, edit an existing
    shortcut. There are two methods for doing this.
  </para>

  <procedure>
    <title>Using dynamic keyboard shortcuts</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        First, you have to activate this capability by checking the
        <guilabel>Use dynamic keyboard shortcuts</guilabel> option in
        the <guilabel>Interface</guilabel> item of the
        <link linkend="gimp-prefs-interface">Preferences</link> menu.  This
        option is usually not checked, to prevent accidental key presses
        from creating an unwanted shortcut.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        While you're doing that, also check the <guilabel>Save keyboard
        shortcuts on exit</guilabel> option so that your shortcut will
        be saved.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        To create a keyboard shortcut, simply place the mouse pointer on a
        command in the menu: it will then be highlighted. Be careful that the
        mouse pointer doesn't move and type a sequence of three keys, keeping
        the keys pressed. You will see this sequence appear on the right of
        the command.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        It is best to use the
        <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
          <keycap>Alt</keycap>
          <keycap>Key</keycap>
        </keycombo>
        sequence for your custom shortcuts.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>

  <figure>
    <title>Configure Keyboard Shortcuts</title>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata format="PNG"
          fileref="images/dialogs/dialogs-shortcuts.png"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </figure>

  <procedure>
    <title>Using the Keyboard Shortcut Editor</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        You get to this Editor by clicking on <guibutton>Configure
        keyboard shortcuts</guibutton> in the <quote>Interface</quote>
        item of the <link linkend="gimp-prefs-interface">Preferences</link> menu.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        As shown in this dialog, you can select the command you want to
        create a shortcut for, in the <quote>Action</quote> area. Then you
        type your key sequence as above. In principle, the Space bar should
        clear a shortcut. (In practice, it clears it, but doesn't delete it.)
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        This shortcut editor also allows you to <emphasis>control the
        tool parameter settings</emphasis> with the keyboard. At the top
        of this dialog, you can find a <guilabel>Context</guilabel> menu
        that takes you to the tool parameters. To make your work easier,
        tool types are marked with small icons.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>

  <note>
    <para>
      Custom Keyboard shortcuts are stored in one of Gimp's hidden
      directory (<filename
      class="directory">/home/[username]/.gimp-2.8/menurc</filename>)
      under Linux, and
      <filename class="directory"
      role="html">C:\Documents and Settings\[Username]\.gimp-2.8\menurc</filename>
      <filename class="directory"
      role="tex">C:\\Documents and Settings\\[Username]\\.gimp-2.8\\menurc</filename>
      under Windows XP.  It is a simple text file that you can transport from
      one computer to another.
