    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      One of the most common uses of GIMP is to fix digital camera images
      that for some reason are less than perfect. Maybe the image is
      overexposed or underexposed; maybe rotated a bit; maybe out of focus:
      these are all common problems for which GIMP has good tools. The purpose
      of this chapter is to give you an overview of those tools and the
      situations in which they are useful. You will not find detailed
      tutorials here: in most cases it is easier to learn how to use the tools
      by experimenting with them than by reading about them. (Also, each tool
      is described more thoroughly in the Help section devoted to it.) You
      will also not find anything in this chapter about the multitude of
      "special effects" that you can apply to an image using GIMP. You should
      be familiar with basic GIMP concepts before reading this chapter, but
      you certainly don't need to be an expertâ€“if you are, you probably know
      most of this anyway. And don't hesitate to experiment: GIMP's powerful
      "undo" system allows you to recover from almost any mistake with a
      simple <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most commonly the things that you want to do to clean up an imperfect
      photo are of four types: improving the composition; improving the
      colors; improving the sharpness; and removing artifacts or other
      undesirable elements of the image.

    <sect3 id="gimp-using-photography-rotating">
      <title>Rotating an Image</title>
      <para>
        It is easy, when taking a picture, to hold the camera not quite
        perfectly vertical, resulting in a picture where things are
        tilted at an angle.  In GIMP, the way to fix this is to use the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-rotate">Rotate</link> tool.
        Activate this by clicking its icon
        <guiicon>
          <inlinegraphic fileref="images/toolbox/stock-tool-rotate-22.png"/>
        </guiicon>
        in the Toolbox, or by pressing the
        <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> while
        inside the image. Make sure the Tool Options are visible, and at
        the top, make sure for <quote>Transform:</quote> that the left
        button (<quote>Transform Layer</quote>) is selected.  If you then
        click the mouse inside the image and drag it, you will see a grid
        appear that rotates as you drag.  When the grid looks right, click
        <guibutton>Rotate</guibutton> or press <keycap>Enter</keycap>, and
        the image will be rotated.
      </para>
      <para>
        Now as a matter of fact, it isn't so easy to get things right by this
        method: you often find that things are better but not quite perfect.
        One solution is to rotate a bit more, but there is a disadvantage to
        that approach. Each time you rotate an image, because the rotated
        pixels don't line up precisely with the original pixels, the image
        inevitably gets blurred a little bit. For a single rotation, the
        amount of blurring is quite small, but two rotations cause twice as
        much blurring as one, and there is no reason to blur things more than
        you have to. A better alternative is to undo the rotation and then do
        another, adjusting the angle.
      </para>
      <para>
        Fortunately, GIMP provides another way of doing it that is
        considerably easier to use: in the Rotate Tool Options, for the
        Transform Direction you can select "Backward (Corrective)". When you
        do this, instead of rotating the grid to compensate for the error, you
        can rotate it to <emphasis>line up</emphasis>
        with the error. If this seems confusing, try it and you will see that
        it is quite straightforward.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          Since GIMP 2.2, there is an option to preview the results of
          transformations, instead of just seeing a grid. This makes it easier
          to get things right on the first try.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        After you have rotated an image, there will be unpleasant triangular
        "holes" at the corners. One way to fix them is to create a background
        that fills the holes with some unobtrusive or neutral color, but
        usually a better solution is to crop the image. The greater the
        rotation, the more cropping is required, so it is best to get the
        camera aligned as well as possible when you take the picture in the
        first place.

      <para>
        When you take a picture with a digital camera, you have some control
        over what gets included in the image but often not as much as you
        would like: the result is images that could benefit from trimming.
        Beyond this, it is often possible to enhance the impact of an image by
        trimming it so that the most important elements are placed at key
        points. A rule of thumb, not always to be followed but good to keep in
        mind, is the <quote>rule of thirds</quote>,
        which says that maximum impact is obtained by placing the center of
        interest one-third of the way across the image, both widthwise and
        heightwise.
      </para>
      <para>
        To crop an image, activate the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-crop">Crop</link>
        tool in the Toolbox, or by pressing the <quote>C</quote>
        key (capitalized) while inside the image. With the tool active,
        clicking and dragging in the image will sweep out a crop rectangle. It
        will also pop up a dialog that allows you to adjust the dimensions of
        the crop region if they aren't quite right. When everything is
        perfect, hit the <guibutton>Crop</guibutton> button in the dialog.

      <title>Automated Tools</title>
      <para>
        In spite of sophisticated exposure-control systems, pictures taken
        with digital cameras often come out over- or under-exposed, or with
        color casts due to imperfections in lighting. GIMP gives you a variety
        of tools to correct colors in an image, ranging to automated tools
        that run with a simple button-click to highly sophisticated tools that
        give you many parameters of control. We will start with the simplest
        first.
      </para>
      <para>
        GIMP gives you several automated color correction
        tools. Unfortunately they don't usually give you quite the results
        you are looking for, but they only take a moment to try out, and if
        nothing else they often give you an idea of some of the
        possibilities inherent in the image.  Except for "Auto Levels", you
        can find these tools by following the menu path
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Colors</guimenu>
          <guisubmenu>Auto</guisubmenu>
        </menuchoice>
        in the image menu.
      </para>
      <para>Here they are, with a few words about each:</para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              This tool (it is really a plug-in) is useful for underexposed
              images: it adjusts the whole image uniformly until the brightest
              point is right at the saturation limit, and the darkest point is
              black. The downside is that the amount of brightening is
              determined entirely by the lightest and darkest points in the
              image, so even one single white pixel and/or one single black
              pixel will make normalization ineffective.

              This is a very powerful adjustment that tries to spread the
              colors in the image evenly across the range of possible
              intensities. In some cases the effect is amazing, bringing out
              contrasts that are very difficult to get in any other way; but
              more commonly, it just makes the image look weird. Oh well, it
              only takes a moment to try.

              This command increases the saturation range of the colors in the
              layer, without altering brightness or hue. So this command does
              not work on grayscale images.

              independently. It often has the useful effect of reducing color
              casts.

              and then pressing the <guibutton>Auto</guibutton> button near
              the center of the dialog. You will see a preview of the result;
              you must press <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> for it to take
              effect. Pressing <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> instead will
              cause your image to revert to its previous state.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you can find a point in the image that ought to be perfect
              white, and a second point that ought to be perfect black, then
              you can use the Levels tool to do a semi-automatic adjustment
              that will often do a good job of fixing both brightness and
              colors throughout the image. First, bring up the Levels tool as
              previously described. Now, look down near the bottom of the
              Layers dialog for three buttons with symbols on them that look
              like eye-droppers (at least, that is what they are supposed to
              look like). The one on the left, if you mouse over it, shows its
              function to be <quote>Pick Black Point</quote>.
              Click on this, then click on a point in the image that ought
              to be blackâ€“really truly perfectly black, not just sort of
              darkâ€“and watch the image change. Next, click on the rightmost of
              the three buttons ( <quote>Pick White Point</quote>
              ), and then click a point in the image that ought to be white,
              and once more watch the image change. If you are happy with the
              result, click the <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> button otherwise
              <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.
            </para>

      </variablelist>
      <para>
        Those are the automated color adjustments: if you find that none of
        them quite does the job for you, it is time to try one of the
        interactive color tools. All of these, except one, can be accessed via
        Tools-&gt;Color Tools in the image menu. After you select a color tool,
        click on the image (anywhere) to activate it and bring up its dialog.

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="gimp-using-photography-exposure">
      <title>Exposure Problems</title>
      <para>
        The simplest tool to use is the <link linkend="gimp-tool-brightness-contrast">Brightness/Contrast</link>
        tool.  It is also the least powerful, but in many cases it does
        everything you need. This tool is often useful for images that are
        overexposed or underexposed; it is not useful for correcting color
        casts.  The tool gives you two sliders to adjust, for
        <quote>Brightness</quote> and <quote>Contrast</quote>.  If you have
        the option <quote>Preview</quote> checked (and almost certainly you
        should),you will see any adjustments you make reflected in the
        image. When you are happy with the results, press
        <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> and they will take effect.  If you
        can't get results that you are happy with, press
        <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> and the image will revert to its
        previous state.
      </para>
      <para>
        A more sophisticated, and only slightly more difficult, way of
        correcting exposure problems is to use the Levels tool.  The
        dialog for this tool looks very complicated, but for the basic
        usage we have in mind here, the only part you need to deal
        with is the <quote>Input Levels</quote> area, specifically the three
        triangular sliders that appear below the histogram.  We refer
        you to the <link linkend="gimp-tool-levels">Levels Tool Help</link>
        for instructions;
        but actually the easiest way to learn how to use it is to
        experiment by moving the three sliders around, and watching
        how the image is affected.  (Make sure that <quote>Preview</quote> is
        checked at the bottom of the dialog.)
      </para>
      <para>
        A very powerful way of correcting exposure problems is to use the
        <emphasis>Curves</emphasis>
        tool. This tool allows you to click and drag control points on a
        curve, in order to create a function mapping input brightness levels
        to output brightness levels. The Curves tool can replicate any effect
        you can achieve with Brightness/Contrast or the Levels tool, so it is
        more powerful than either of them. Once again, we refer you to the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-curves">Curves Tool Help</link>
        for detailed instructions, but the easiest way to learn how to use it
        is by experimenting.
      </para>
      <para>
        The most powerful approach to adjusting brightness and contrast across
        an image, for more expert GIMP users, is to create a new layer above
        the one you are working on, and then in the Layers dialog set the Mode
        for the upper layer to <quote>Multiply</quote>.
        The new layer then serves as a <quote>gain control</quote>
        layer for the layer below it, with white yielding maximum gain and
        black yielding a gain of zero. Thus, by painting on the new layer, you
        can selectively adjust the gain for each area of the image, giving you
        very fine control. You should try to paint only with smooth gradients,
        because sudden changes in gain will give rise to spurious edges in the
        result. Paint only using shades of gray, not colors, unless you want
        to produce color shifts in the image.
      </para>
      <para>
        Actually, <quote>Multiply</quote> is not the only mode that is useful
        for gain control.  In fact, <quote>Multiply</quote> mode can only
        darken parts of an image, never lighten them, so it is only useful
        where some parts of an image are overexposed.  Using
        <quote>Divide</quote> mode has the opposite effect:  it can brighten
        areas of an image but not darken them.  Here is a trick that is often
        useful for bringing out the maximum amount of detail across all areas
        of an image:
      </para>
      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>
            Duplicate the layer (producing a new layer above it).
          </para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Desaturate the new layer.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            Apply a Gaussian blur to the result, with a large radius (100 or
            more).
          </para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Set Mode in the Layers dialog to Divide.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            Control the amount of correction by adjusting opacity in the
            Layers dialog, or by using Brightness/Contrast, Levels, or Curves
            tools on the new layer.
          </para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>
            When you are happy with the result, you can use
            <guibutton>Merge Down</guibutton>
            to combine the control layer and the original layer into a single
            layer.
          </para>
        </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>
        In addition to <quote>Multiply</quote> and <quote>Divide</quote>, you
        may every so often get useful effects with other layer combination
        modes, such as <quote>Dodge</quote>, <quote>Burn</quote>, or
        <quote>Soft Light</quote>.  It is all too easy, though,
        once you start playing with these things, to look away from
        the computer for a moment and suddenly find that you have just
        spent an hour twiddling parameters.  Be warned: the more
        options you have, the harder it is to make a decision.

      <para>
        In our experience, if your image has a color cast---too much red, too
        much blue, etc---the easiest way to correct it is to use the Levels
        tool, adjusting levels individually on the red, green, and blue
        channels. If this doesn't work for you, it might be worth your while
        to try the Color Balance tool or the Curves tool, but these are much
        more difficult to use effectively. (They are very good for creating
        certain types of special effects, though.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Sometimes it is hard to tell whether you have adjusted colors
        adequately. A good, objective technique is to find a point in the
        image that you know should be either white or a shade of gray.

        <link linkend="gimp-tool-color-picker">Color Picker</link>
        tool (the eyedropper symbol in the Toolbox), and click on the
        aforesaid point: this brings up the Color Picker dialog. If the colors
        are correctly adjusted, then the red, green, and blue components of
        the reported color should all be equal; if not, then you should see
        what sort of adjustment you need to make. This technique, when well
        used, allows even color-blind people to color-correct an image.

        If your image is washed out---which can easily happen when you take
        pictures in bright light---try the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-hue-saturation">Hue/Saturation</link>
        tool, which gives you three sliders to manipulate, for Hue, Lightness,
        and Saturation. Raising the saturation will probably make the image
        look better. In same cases it is useful to adjust the lightness at the
        same time. ( <quote>Lightness</quote> here is similar to
        <quote>Brightness</quote>
        in the Brightness/Contrast tool, except that they are formed from
        different combinations of the red, green, and blue channels.) The
        Hue/Saturation tool gives you the option of adjusting restricted
        subranges of colors (using the buttons at the top of the dialog), but
        if you want to get natural-looking colors, in most cases you should
        avoid doing this.
      </para>
      <tip>
        <para>
          Even if an image does not seemed washed out, often you can increase
          its impact by pushing up the saturation a bit. Veterans of the film
          era sometimes call this trick <quote>Fujifying</quote>,
          after Fujichrome film, which is notorious for producing highly
          saturated prints.

      </tip>
      <para>
        When you take pictures in low light conditions, in some cases you have
        the opposite problem: too much saturation. In this case too the
        Hue/Saturation tool is a good one to use, only by reducing the
        saturation instead of increasing it.

      <para>
        If the focus on the camera is not set perfectly, or the camera is
        moving when the picture is taken, the result is a blurred image. If
        there is a lot of blurring, you probably won't be able to do much
        about it with any technique, but if there is only a moderate amount,
        you should be able to improve the image.
      </para>
      <para>
        The most generally useful technique for sharpening a fuzzy image is
        called the <link linkend="plug-in-unsharp-mask">Unsharp Mask</link>.
        In spite of the rather confusing name, which derives from its
        origins as a technique used by film developers, its result is to make
        the image sharper, not <quote>unsharp</quote>.
        It is a plug-in, and you can access it as Filters-&gt;Enhance-&gt;Unsharp
        Mask in the image menu. There are two parameters,
        <quote>Radius</quote> and <quote>Amount</quote>.
        The default values often work pretty well, so you should try them
        first. Increasing either the radius or the amount increases the
        strength of the effect. Don't get carried away, though: if you make
        the unsharp mask too strong, it will amplify noise in the image and
        also give rise to visible artifacts where there are sharp edges.
      </para>
      <tip>
        <para>
          Sometimes using Unsharp Mask can cause color distortion where there
          are strong contrasts in an image. When this happens, you can often
          get better results by decomposing the image into separate
          Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) layers, and running Unsharp Mask on the
          Value layer only, then recomposing. This works because the human eye
          has much finer resolution for brightness than for color. See the
          sections on
          <link linkend="plug-in-decompose-registered">Decompose</link> and

      <para>
        Next to "Unsharp Mask" in the Filters menu is another filter called
        <link linkend="plug-in-sharpen">Sharpen</link>,
        which does similar things. It is a little easier to use but not
        nearly as effective: our recommendation is that you ignore it and go
        straight to Unsharp Mask.
      </para>
      <para>
        In some situations, you may be able to get useful results by
        selectively sharpening specific parts of an image using the
        <link linkend="gimp-tool-convolve">Blur or Sharpen</link>
        tool from the Toolbox, in "Sharpen" mode. This allows you to increase
        the sharpness in areas by painting over them with any paintbrush. You
        should be restrained about this, though, or the results will not look
        very natural: sharpening increases the apparent sharpness of edges in
        the image, but also amplifies noise.

      <title>Reducing Graininess</title>
      <para>
        When you take pictures in low-light conditions or with a very fast
        exposure time, the camera does not get enough data to make good
        estimates of the true color at each pixel, and consequently the
        resulting image looks grainy. You can <quote>smooth out</quote>
        the graininess by blurring the image, but then you will also lose
        sharpness. There are a couple of approaches that may give better
        results. Probably the best, if the graininess is not too bad, is to
        use the filter called
        <link linkend="plug-in-sel-gauss">Selective Blur</link>,
        setting the blurring radius to 1 or 2 pixels. The other approach is
        to use the <link linkend="plug-in-despeckle">Despeckle</link>
        filter. This has a nice preview, so you can play with the settings and
        try to find some that give good results. When graininess is really
        bad, though, it is often very difficult to fix by anything except
        heroic measures (i.e., retouching with paint tools).

        Every so often you have the opposite problem: an image is

        crisp. The solution is to blur it a bit: fortunately blurring an image
        is much easier than sharpening it. Since you probably don't want to
        blur it very much, the simplest method is to use the
        <quote>Blur</quote>
        plug-in, accessed via Filters-&gt;Blur-&gt;Blur from the image menu. This
        will soften the focus of the image a little bit. If you want more

      There are two kinds of objects you might want to remove from an image:
      first, artifacts caused by junk such as dust or hair on the lens;
      second, things that were really present but impair the quality of the
      image, such as a telephone wire running across the edge of a beautiful

    <sect3 id="gimp-using-photography-despeckling">
      <title>Despeckling</title>

        A good tool for removing dust and other types of lens grunge is the
        <link linkend="plug-in-despeckle">Despeckle</link>
        filter, accessed as Filters-&gt;Enhance-&gt;Despeckle from the image menu.
        Very important: to use this filter effectively, you must begin by
        making a small selection containing the artifact and a small area
        around it. The selection must be small enough so that the artifact
        pixels are statistically distinguishable from the other pixels inside
        the selection. If you try to run despeckle on the whole image, you
        will hardly ever get anything useful. Once you have created a
        reasonable selection, activate Despeckle, and watch the preview as you
        adjust the parameters. If you are lucky, you will be able to find a
        setting that removes the junk while minimally affecting the area
        around it. The more the junk stands out from the area around it, the
        better your results are likely to be. If it isn't working for you, it
        might be worthwhile to cancel the filter, create a different
        selection, and then try again.

          <inlinegraphic fileref="images/toolbox/stock-tool-clone-22.png"/>
        </guiicon>
        tool, which allows you to paint over one part of an image using pixel
        data taken from another part (or even from a different image). The
        trick to using the clone tool effectively is to be able to find a
        different part of the image that can be used to
        <quote>copy over</quote>
        the unwanted part: if the area surrounding the unwanted object is very
        different from the rest of the image, you won't have much luck. For
        example, if you have a lovely beach scene, with a nasty human walking
        across the beach who you would like to teleport away, you will
        probably be able to find an empty part of the beach that looks similar
        to the part he is walking across, and use it to clone over him. It is
        quite astonishing how natural the results can look when this technique
        works well.

        but persistence will pay off.

        Another tool looking very much as the clone tool, but smarter, is the

        When you take a flash picture of somebody who is looking directly

        flash back toward the camera in such a way as to make the eye appear
        bright red: this effect is called <quote>red eye</quote>,
        and looks very bizarre. Many modern cameras have special flash modes
        that minimize red-eye, but they only work if you use them, and even
        then they don't always work perfectly. Interestingly, the same effect
        occurs with animals, but the eyes may show up as other colors, such as
        green.

            If you intend to open the image in GIMP again for further work,
            you should save it in GIMP's native XCF format (i. e., name it

            that none of the information in the image is lost.

            If you intend to print the image on paper, you should avoid
            shrinking the image, except by cropping it. The reason is that
            printers are capable of achieving much higher resolutions than
            video monitors &mdash; 600 to 1400 dpi (<quote>dots per
            inch</quote>, the physical density) for typical printers, as
            compared to 72 to 100 pixels per inch for monitors. A
            3000&nbsp;x&nbsp;5000-pixel image looks huge on a monitor, but it
            only comes to about 5 inches by 8 inches on paper at 600 ppi.
            There is usually no good reason to <emphasis>expand</emphasis> the
            image either: you can't increase the true resolution that way, and
            it can always be scaled up at the time it is printed. As for the
            file format, it will usually be fine to use JPEG at a quality
            level of 75 to 85. In rare cases, where there are large swaths of
            nearly uniform color, you may need to set the quality level even
            higher or use a lossless format such as TIFF instead.

            If you intend to display the image on screen or project it with a

        Modern digital cameras, when you take a picture, add information to
        the data file about the camera settings and the circumstances under
        which the picture was taken. This data is included in JPEG or TIFF
        files in a structured format called EXIF. For JPEG files, GIMP is
        capable of maintaining EXIF data, if it is built appropriately: it
        depends on a library called <quote>libexif</quote>,
        which may not be available on all systems. If GIMP is built with
        EXIF support enabled, then loading a JPEG file with EXIF data, and
        resaving the resulting image in JPEG format, will cause the EXIF data
        to be preserved unchanged. This is not, strictly speaking, the right
        way for an image editor to handle EXIF data, but it is better than
        simply removing it, which is what earlier versions of GIMP did.
