  <para lang="en">  
    One of the most common uses of the Gimp is to fix digital camera
    images that for some reason are less than perfect.  Maybe the
    image is overexposed or underexposed; maybe rotated a bit; maybe
    out of focus: these are all common problems for which Gimp has
    good tools.  The purpose of this chapter is to give you an
    overview of those tools and the situations in which they are
    useful.  You will not find detailed tutorials here: in most cases
    it is easier to learn how to use the tools by experimenting with
    them than by reading about them.  (Also, each tool is described
    more thoroughly in the Help section devoted to it.)  You will also
    not find anything in this chapter about the multitude of "special
    effects" that you can apply to an image using Gimp.  You should be
    familiar with basic Gimp concepts before reading this chapter, but
    you certainly don't need to be an expert–if you are, you
    probably know most of this anyway.  And don't hesitate to
    experiment: Gimp's powerful "undo" system allows you to recover
    from almost any mistake with a simple Ctrl-Z.

    Most commonly the things that you want to do to clean up an
    imperfect photo are of four types:  improving the composition;
    improving the colors; improving the sharpness; and removing
    artifacts or other undesirable elements of the image.

    <title lang="en">Rotating an Image</title>
    <para lang="en">
      It is easy, when taking a picture, to hold the camera not quite
      perfectly vertical, resulting in a picture where things are
      tilted at an angle.  In Gimp, the way to fix this is to use the
      <link linkend='gimp-tool-rotate'>Rotate</link> tool.
      Activate this by clicking its icon in the Toolbox, or by
      pressing the "R" key capitalized) while inside the image.  Make
      sure the Tool Options are visible, and at the top, make sure for
      "Affect:" that the left button ("Transform Layer") is selected.
      If you then click the mouse inside the image and drag it, you
      will see a grid appear that rotates as you drag.  When the grid
      looks right, click <guibutton>okay</guibutton> and the image will be rotated. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Now as a matter of fact, it isn't so easy to get things right by
      this method:  you often find that things are better but not
      quite perfect.  One solution is to rotate a bit more, but there
      is a disadvantage to that approach.  Each time you rotate an
      image, because the rotated pixels don't line up precisely with
      the original pixels, the image inevitably gets blurred a little
      bit.  For a single rotation, the amount of blurring is quite
      small, but two rotations cause twice as much blurring as one,
      and there is no reason to blur things more than you have to.  A
      better alternative is to undo the rotation and then do another,
      adjusting the angle. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Fortunately, Gimp provides another way of doing it that is
      considerably easier to use: in the Rotate Tool Options, for the
      Transform Direction you can select "Backward (Corrective)".
      When you do this, instead of rotating the grid to compensate for
      the error, you can rotate it to <emphasis>line up</emphasis>
      with the error. If this seems confusing, try it and you will see
      that it is quite straightforward.
    </para>
    <note lang="en">
      Note: New in Gimp 2.2 is the option to preview the results of
      transformations, instead of just seeing a grid.  This makes it
      easier to get things right on the first try.)
    </note>
    <para>
      After you have rotated an image, there will be unpleasant
      triangular "holes" at the corners.  One way to fix them is to
      create a background that fills the holes with some unobtrusive
      or neutral color, but usually a better solution is to crop the
      image.  The greater the rotation, the more cropping is required,
      so it is best to get the camera aligned as well as possible when
      you take the picture in the first place.

    <para lang="en">
      When you take a picture with a digital camera, you have some
      control over what gets included in the image but often not as
      much as you would like:  the result is images that could benefit
      from trimming. Beyond this, it is often possible to enhance the
      impact of an image by trimming it so that the most important
      elements are placed at key points.  A rule of thumb, not always
      to be followed but good to keep in mind, is the "rule of
      thirds", which says that maximum impact is obtained by placing
      the center of interest one-third of the way across the image,
      both widthwise and heightwise.   
    </para>
    <para>
      To crop an image, activate the <link
      linkend='gimp-tool-crop'>Crop</link> tool in the Toolbox, or by
      pressing the "C" key (capitalized) while inside the image.  With
      the tool active, clicking and dragging in the image will sweep
      out a crop rectangle.  It will also pop up a dialog that allows
      you to adjust the dimensions of the crop region if they aren't
      quite right.  When everything is perfect, hit the <guibutton>Crop</guibutton> button
      in the dialog.

    <title lang="en">Automated Tools</title>
    <para lang="en">
      In spite of sophisticated exposure-control systems, pictures
      taken with digital cameras often come out over- or
      under-exposed, or with color casts due to imperfections in
      lighting.  Gimp gives you a variety of tools to correct colors
      in an image, ranging to automated tools that run with a simple
      button-click to highly sophisticated tools that give you many
      parameters of control.  We will start with the simplest first.
    </para>
    <para>
      Gimp gives you five automated color correction tools.
      Unfortunately they don't usually give you quite the results you
      are looking for, but  they only take a moment to try out, and if
      nothing else they often give you an idea of some of the
      possibilities inherent in the image.  Except for "Auto Levels",
      you can find them in the Layer menu, by following the menu path
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Layer</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Colors</guisubmenu>

          This tool (it is really a plug-in) is useful for
          underexposed images:  it adjusts the whole image uniformly
          until the brightest point is right at the saturation limit,
          and the darkest point is black.  The downside is that the
          amount of brightening is determined entirely by the lightest
          and darkest points in the image, so even one single white
          pixel and/or one single black pixel will make normalization
          ineffective.

          This is a very powerful adjustment that tries to spread the
          colors in the image evenly across the range of possible

          out contrasts that are very difficult to get in any other
          way; but more commonly, it just makes the image look weird.

          This is like "Normalize", except that it operates on the

          for it to take

          If you can find a point in the image that ought to be
          perfect white, and a second point that ought to be perfect
          black, then you can use the Levels tool to do a
          semi-automatic adjustment that will often do a good job of
          fixing both brightness and colors throughout the
          image. First, bring up the Levels tool as previously
          described.  Now, look down near the bottom of the Layers
          dialog for three buttons with symbols on them that look like
          eye-droppers (at least, that is what they are supposed to
          look like).  The one on the left, if you mouse over it,
          shows its function to be 
          "Pick Black Point".  Click on this,
          then click on a point in the image that ought to be
          black–really truly perfectly black, not just sort of
          dark–and watch the image change.  Next, click on the
          rightmost of the three buttons ("Pick White Point"), and
          then click a point in the image that ought to be white, and
          once more watch the image change.  If you are happy with the
          result, click the <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> button; otherwise <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.

      Those are the automated color adjustments:  if you find

    <title lang="en">Exposure Problems</title>
    <para lang="en">
      The simplest tool to use is the <link
      linkend='gimp-tool-brightness-contrast'>Brightness/Contrast</link>
      tool.  It 
      is also the least powerful, but in many cases it does
      everything you need. This tool is often useful for images that
      are overexposed or underexposed; it is not useful for
      correcting color casts.  The tool gives you two sliders to
      adjust, for "Brightness" and "Contrast".  If you have the
      option "Preview" checked (and almost certainly you should),
      you will see any adjustments you make reflected in the
      image. When you are happy with the results, press <guibutton>Okay</guibutton> and
      they will take effect.  If you can't get results that you are
      happy with, press <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> and the image will revert to its
      previous state. 
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      A more sophisticated, and only slightly more difficult, way of
      correcting exposure problems is to use the Levels tool.  The
      dialog for this tool looks very complicated, but for the basic
      usage we have in mind here, the only part you need to deal
      with is the "Input Levels" area, specifically the three
      triangular sliders that appear below the histogram.  We refer
      you to the <link linkend='gimp-tool-levels'>Levels Tool Help</link>
      for instructions; 
      but actually the easiest way to learn how to use it is to
      experiment by moving the three sliders around, and watching
      how the image is affected.  (Make sure that "Preview" is
      checked at the bottom of the dialog.) 
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      A very powerful way of correcting exposure problems is to use
      the Curves tool.  This tool allows you to click and drag
      control points on a curve, in order to create a function
      mapping input brightness levels to output brightness levels.
      The Curves tool can replicate any effect you can achieve with
      Brightness/Contrast or the Levels tool, so it is more powerful
      than either of them.  Once again, we refer you to the
      <link linkend='gimp-tool-curves'>Curves Tool Help</link>for
      detailed instructions, but the 
      easiest way to learn how to use it is by experimenting.  
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      The most powerful approach to adjusting brightness and
      contrast across an image, for more expert Gimp users, is to
      create a new layer above the one you are working on, and then
      in the Layers dialog set the Mode for the upper layer to
      "Multiply".  The new layer then serves as a "gain control"
      layer for the layer below it, with white yielding maximum gain
      and black yielding a gain of zero.  Thus, by painting on the
      new layer, you can selectively adjust the gain for each area
      of the image, giving you very fine control.  You should try to
      paint only with smooth gradients, because sudden changes in
      gain will give rise to spurious edges in the result.  Paint
      only using shades of gray, not colors, unless you want to
      produce color shifts in the image.
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      Actually, "Multiply" is not the only mode that is useful for
      gain control.  In fact, "Multiply" mode can only darken parts
      of an image, never lighten them, so it is only useful where
      some parts of an image are overexposed.  Using "Divide" mode
      has the opposite effect:  it can brighten areas of an image
      but not darken them.  Here is a trick that is often useful for
      bringing out the maximum amount of detail across all areas of
      an image:
    </para>
    <procedure lang="en">
    <step>
      Duplicate the layer (producing a new layer above it).
    </step>
    <step>
      Desaturate the new layer.
    </step>
    <step>
      Apply a Gaussian blur to the result, with a large radius
      (100 or more).
    </step>
    <step>
      Set Mode in the Layers dialog to Divide.
    </step>
    <step>
      Control the amount of correction by adjusting opacity in the
      Layers dialog, or by using Brightness/Contrast, Levels, or
      Curves tools on the new layer.
    </step>
    <step>
      When you are happy with the result, you can use <guibutton>Merge Down</guibutton>
      to combine the control layer and the original layer into a
      single layer.
    </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>
      In addition to "Multiply" and "Divide", you may every so often
      get useful effects with other layer combination modes, such as
      "Dodge", "Burn", or "Soft Light".  It is all too easy, though,
      once you start playing with these things, to look away from
      the computer for a moment and suddenly find that you have just
      spent an hour twiddling parameters.  Be warned: the more
      options you have, the harder it is to make a decision.

    <title lang="en">Adjusting Hue and Saturation</title>
    <para lang="en">
      In our experience, if your image has a color cast---too much
      red, too much blue, etc---the easiest way to correct it is to
      use the Levels tool, adjusting levels individually on the red,
      green, and blue channels.  If this doesn't work for you, it
      might be worth your while to try the Color Balance tool or the
      Curves tool, but these are much more difficult to use
      effectively.  (They are very good for creating certain types
      of special effects, though.) 
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      Sometimes it is hard to tell whether you have adjusted colors
      adequately.  A good, objective technique is to find a point in
      the image that you know should be either white or a shade of
      gray. Activate the <link
      linkend='gimp-tool-color-picker'>Color Picker</link> tool (the
      eyedropper symbol in the Toolbox), and click on the aforesaid
      point: this brings up the Color Picker dialog.  If the colors
      are correctly adjusted, then the red, green, and blue
      components of the reported color should all be equal; if not,
      then you should see what sort of adjustment you need to make.
      This technique, when well used, allows even color-blind people
      to color-correct an image.
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      If your image is washed out---which can easily happen when you
      take pictures in bright light---try the Hue/Saturation tool,
      which gives you three sliders to manipulate, for Hue,
      Lightness, and Saturation. Raising the saturation will
      probably make the image look better.  In same cases it is
      useful to adjust the lightness at the same time. ("Lightness"
      here is similar to "Brightness" in the Brightness/Contrast
      tool, except that they are formed from different combinations
      of the red, green, and blue channels.)  The Hue/Saturation
      tool gives you the option of adjusting restricted subranges of
      colors (using the buttons at the top of the dialog), but if
      you want to get natural-looking colors, in most cases you
      should avoid doing this.
    </para>
    <tip lang="en">
      Even if an image does not seemed washed out, often you can
      increase its impact by pushing up the saturation a bit.
      Veterans of the film era sometimes call this trick
      "Fujifying", after Fujichrome film, which is notorious for
      producing highly saturated prints.
    </tip>
    <para lang="en">
      When you take pictures in low light conditions, in some cases
      you have the opposite problem: too much saturation.  In this
      case too the Hue/Saturation tool is a good one to use, only by
      reducing the saturation instead of increasing it.

    <title lang="en">Unblurring</title>
    <para lang="en">
      If the focus on the camera is not set perfectly, or the camera
      is moving when the picture is taken, the result is a blurred
      image.  If there is a lot of blurring, you probably won't be
      able to do much about it with any technique, but if there is
      only a moderate amount, you should be able to improve the image.
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      The most generally useful technique for sharpening a fuzzy image
      is called the <link linkend='plug-in-unsharp-mask'>Unsharp
      Mask</link>.  In spite of the rather confusing name, which
      derives from its origins as a technique used by film developers,
      its result is to make the image sharper, not "unsharp".  It is a
      plug-in, and you can access it as Filters->Enhance->Unsharp Mask
      in the image menu.  There are two parameters, "Radius" and
      "Amount".  The default values often work pretty well, so you
      should try them first.  Increasing either the radius or the
      amount increases the strength of the effect.  Don't get carried
      away, though: if you make the unsharp mask too strong, it will
      amplify noise in the image and also give rise to visible
      artifacts where there are sharp edges. 
    </para>
    <tip lang="en">
      Sometimes using Unsharp Mask can cause color distortion where
      there are strong contrasts in an image.  When this happens, you
      can often get better results by decomposing the image into
      separate Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) layers, and running Unsharp
      Mask on the Value layer only, then recomposing.  This works
      because the human eye has much finer resolution for brightness
      than for color.  See the sections on <link
      linkend='plug-in-decompose'>Decompose</link> and <link
      linkend='plug-in-compose'>Compose</link> for more information.
    </tip>
    <para lang="en">
      Next to "Unsharp Mask" in the Filters menu is another filter
      called <link linkend='plug-in-sharpen'>Sharpen</link>, which
      does similar things.  It is a little easier to use but not
      nearly as effective:  our recommendation is that you ignore it
      and go straight to Unsharp Mask.
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      In some situations, you may be able to get useful results by
      selectively sharpening specific parts of an image using the
      <link linkend='gimp-tool-convolve'>Blur or Sharpen</link> tool
      from the Toolbox, in "Sharpen" mode.  This allows you to
      increase the sharpness in areas by painting over them with any
      paintbrush.  You should be restrained about this, though, or the
      results will not look very natural:  sharpening increases the
      apparent sharpness of edges in the image, but also amplifies noise.

    <title lang="en">Reducing Graininess</title>
    <para lang="en">
      When you take pictures in low-light conditions or with a very
      fast exposure time, the camera does not get enough data to make
      good estimates of the true color at each pixel, and consequently
      the resulting image looks grainy.  You can "smooth out" the
      graininess by blurring the image, but then you will also lose
      sharpness.  There are a couple of approaches that
      may give better results.  Probably the best, if the graininess
      is not too bad, is to use the filter called <link
      linkend='plug-in-selective-blur'>Selective Blur</link>, setting
      the blurring radius to 1 or 2 pixels.  The other approach is to
      use the <link linkend='plug-in-despeckle'>Despeckle</link>
      filter.  This has a nice preview, so you can play with the
      settings and try to find some that give good results.  When
      graininess is really bad, though, it is often very difficult to
      fix by anything except heroic measures (i. e., retouching with
      paint tools).

    <title lang="en">Softening</title>
    <para lang="en">
      Every so often you have the opposite problem:  an image is
      <emphasis>too</emphasis> crisp.  The solution is to blur it a
      bit:  fortunately blurring an image is much easier than
      sharpening it.  Since you probably don't want to blur it very
      much, the simplest method is to use the "Blur" plug-in, accessed
      via Filters->Blur from the image menu.  With the default
      settings and a repeat count of 1, this will soften the focus of
      the image a little bit.  If you want more softening, just repeat
      until you get the result you desire.

  <title lang="en">Removing Unwanted Objects from an Image</title>
  <para lang="en">
    There are two kinds of objects you might want to remove from an
    image: first, artifacts caused by junk such as dust or hair on the
    lens; second, things that were really present but impair the
    quality of the image, such as a telephone wire running across the
    edge of a beautiful mountain landscape.
  </para>

  <simplesect>
    <title lang="en">Despeckling</title>
    <para lang="en">
      A good tool for removing dust and other types of lens grunge
      is the <link linkend='plug-in-despeckle'>Despeckle</link>
      filter, accessed as Filters->Enhance->Despeckle from the image
      menu.  Very important: to use this filter effectively, you
      must begin by making a small selection containing the artifact
      and a small area around it.  The selection must be small
      enough so that the artifact pixels are statistically
      distinguishable from the other pixels inside the selection.
      If you try to run despeckle on the whole image, you will
      hardly ever get anything useful.  Once you have created a
      reasonable selection, activate Despeckle, and watch the
      preview as you adjust the parameters.  If you are lucky, you
      will be able to find a setting that removes the junk while
      minimally affecting the area around it.  The more the junk
      stands out from the area around it, the better your results
      are likely to be.  If it isn't working for you, it might be
      worthwhile to cancel the filter, create a different selection,
      and then try again. 
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      If you have more than one artifact in the image, it is
      necessary to use Despeckle on each individually.

    <title lang="en">Garbage Removal</title>
    <para lang="en">
      The most useful method for removing unwanted "clutter" from an
      image is the <link linkend='gimp-tool-clone'>Clone</link>
      tool, which allows you to paint over one part of an image
      using pixel data taken from another part (or even from a
      different image).  The trick to using the clone tool
      effectively is to be able to find a different part of the
      image that can be used to "copy over" the unwanted part:  if
      the area surrounding the unwanted object is very different
      from the rest of the image, you won't have much luck.  For
      example, if you have a lovely beach scene, with a nasty human
      walking across the beach who you would like to teleport away,
      you will probably be able to find an empty part of the beach
      that looks similar to the part he is walking across, and use
      it to clone over him.  It is quite astonishing how natural the
      results can look when this technique works well.
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      Consult the <link linkend='gimp-tool-clone'>Clone Tool
      Help</link>  for more detailed instructions.  Cloning is as
      much an art as a science, and the more you practice at it, the
      better you will get.  At first it may seem impossible to
      produce anything except ugly blotches, but persistence will
      pay off.  
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      In some cases you may be able to get good results by simply
      cutting out the offending object from the image, and then
      using a plug-in called "Resynthesizer" to fill in the void.
      This plug-in is not included with the main Gimp distribution,
      but it can be obtained from the author's <ulink
      url="http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer">Resynthesizer</ulink>

    <title lang="en">Removing Red-eye</title>
    <para lang="en">
      When you take a flash picture of somebody who is looking
      directly toward the camera, the iris of the eye can bounce the
      light of the flash back toward the camera in such a way as to
      make the eye appear bright red:  this effect is called "red
      eye", and looks very bizarre. Many modern cameras have special
      flash modes that minimize red-eye, but they only work if you
      use them, and even then they don't always work perfectly.
      Interestingly, the same effect occurs with animals, but the
      eyes may show up as other colors, such as green.   
    </para>
    <para lang="en">
      Gimp does not include a special tool for removing red-eye, but it
      isn't all that hard to do.  Basically the idea is to zoom the
      area around the eye so that it is nice and large and easy to
      work with; then make a selection of the red part of the eye
      and a bit of the area around it; feather the selection so that
      you don't create sharp-looking edges; and finally desaturate
      the red channel inside the selection using one of the color
      tools---Levels, Curves, or Hue/Saturation.  It takes a little
      practice the first few times, but once you have the technique
      mastered, you should be able to quickly and easily create
      quite a natural looking eye color.

      If you would like a more automated approach, you can try

      What file format should you use to save the results of your

        If you intend to open the image in Gimp again for further
        work, you should save it in Gimp's native XCF format (i. e.,

        guarantees that none of the information in the image is lost.

        If you intend to print the image on paper, you should avoid 
        shrinking the image, except by cropping it.  The reason is
        that printers are capable of achieving much higher dot
        resolutions than video monitors---600 to 1400 dots per inch
        for typical printers, as compared to 72 to 100 dots per inch
        for monitors.  A 3000 x 5000 image looks huge on a monitor,
        but it only comes to about 5 inches by 8 inches on paper at
        600 dpi.  There is usually no good reason to
        <emphasis>expand</emphasis> the image either:  you can't
        increase the true resolution that way, and it can always be
        scaled up at the time it is printed.  As for the file format,
        it will usually be fine to use JPEG at a quality level of 75
        to 85.  In rare cases, where there are large swaths of nearly
        uniform color, you may need to set the quality level even
        higher or use a lossless format such as TIFF instead.

        If you intend to display the image on screen or project it
        with a video projector, bear in mind that the highest screen
        resolution for most commonly available systems is 1600 x 1200,
        so there is nothing to gain by keeping the image larger than
        that.  For this purpose, the JPEG format is almost always a
        good choice.

        If you want to put the image on a web page or send it by
        email, it is a good idea to make every effort to keep the file
        size as small as possible.  First, scale the image down to the
        smallest size that makes it possible to see the relevant
        details (bear in mind that other people may be using different
        sized monitors and/or different monitor resolution settings).
        Second, save the image as a JPEG file.  In the JPEG save
        dialog, check the option to "Preview in image window", and
        then adjust the Quality slider to the lowest level that gives
        you acceptable image quality.  (You will see in the image the
        effects of each change.)  Make sure that the image is zoomed
        at 1:1 while you do this, so you are not misled by the effects
        of zooming.

    <title lang="en">EXIF Data</title> 
    <para lang="en">
      Modern digital cameras, when you take a picture, add information
      to the data file about the camera settings and the circumstances
      under which the picture was taken.  This data is included in
      JPEG or TIFF files in a structured format called EXIF.  For JPEG
      files, Gimp is capable of maintaining EXIF data, if it is built
      appropriately:  it depends on a library called "libexif", which
      may not be available on all systems.  If Gimp is built with EXIF
      support enabled, then loading a JPEG file with EXIF data, and
      resaving the resulting image in JPEG format, will cause the EXIF
      data to be preserved unchanged.  This is not, strictly speaking,
      the right way for an image editor to handle EXIF data, but it is
      better than simply removing it, which is what earlier versions
      of Gimp did.
