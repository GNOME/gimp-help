    <para lang='en'>
      It is tempting to think of an <emphasis>image</emphasis> as
      something that corresponds a single display window, or to a
      single file such as a JPEG file, but really a Gimp image is a
      rather complicated structure, containing a stack of layers plus
      several other types of objects:  a selection mask, a set of
      channels, a set of paths, an "undo" history, etc.  In this
      section we are going to take a detailed look at all of the
      components of an image, and the things you can do with them.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      The most basic property of an image is its
      <emphasis>mode</emphasis>.  There are three possible modes: RGB,
      grayscale, and indexed. RGB stands
      for Red-Green-Blue, and indicates that each point in the image
      is represented by a "red" level, a "green" level, and a "blue"
      level.  Because every humanly distinguishable color can be
      represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, RGB images
      are full-color.  Each color channel has 256 possible intensity
      levels.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      In a grayscale image, each point is represented by a brightness
      value, ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white), with intermediate
      values representing different levels of gray.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Essentially the difference between a grayscale image and an RGB
      image is the number of "color channels":  a grayscale image has
      one; an RGB image has three.  An RGB image can be thought of as
      three superimposed grayscale images, one colored red, one green,
      and one blue.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Actually, both RGB and grayscale images have one additional
      color channel, called the <emphasis>alpha</emphasis> channel,
      representing opacity.  When the alpha value at a given location
      in a given layer is zero, the layer is completely transparent,
      and the color at that location is determined by what lies
      underneath.  When alpha is maximal, the layer is opaque, and the
      color is determined by the color of the layer.  Intermediate
      alpha values correspond to varying degrees of translucency:  the
      color at the location is a proportionl mixture of color from the
      layer and color from underneath.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      In Gimp, every color channel, including the alpha channel, has a
      range of possible values from 0 to 255; in computing
      terminology, a depth of 8 bits.  Some digital cameras can
      produce image files with a depth of 16 bits per color channel.
      Gimp cannot load such a file without losing resolution.  In most
      cases the effects are too subtle to be detected by the human
      eye, but in some cases, mainly where there are large areas with
      slowly varying color gradients, the difference may be
      perceptible. 
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      The third type, <emphasis>indexed</emphasis> images, is a bit
      more complicated to understand.  In an 
      indexed image, only a limited set of discrete colors are used,
      usually 256 or less.  These colors form the "colormap" of the
      image, and each point in the image is assigned a color from the
      colormap.  Indexed images have the advantage that they can be
      represented inside a computer in a way that consumes relatively
      little memory, and back in the dark ages (say, ten years ago),
      they were very commmonly used.  As time goes on, they are used
      less and less, but they are still important enough to be worth
      supporting in Gimp.  (Also, there are a few important kinds of
      image manipulation that are easier to implement with indexed
      images than with continuous-color RGB images.)
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Some very commonly used types of files (including GIF) produce
      indexed images when they are opened in Gimp.  Many of Gimp's
      tools don't work very well on indexed images--and many filters
      don't work at all--because of the limited number of colors
      available.  Because of this, it is usually best to convert an
      image to RGB mode before working on it.  If necessary, you can
      convert it back to indexed mode when you are ready of save it
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      Gimp makes it easy to convert from one image type to another,
      using the <link linkend='gimp-image-mode'>Mode</link> command in
      the Image menu.  Some types of conversions, of course (RGB to
      grayscale or indexed, for example) lose information that cannot
      be regained by converting back in the other direction.  
    </para>

    <tip lang='en'>
      If you are trying to use a filter on an image, and it appears
      grayed out in the menu, usually the cause is that the image (or,
      more specifically, the layer) you are working on is the wrong
      type.  Many filters can't be used on indexed images.  Some can
      be used only on RGB images, or only on grayscale images.  Some
      also require the presence or absence of an alpha channel.
      Usually the fix is to convert the image to a different type,
      most commonly RGB
