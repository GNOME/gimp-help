      If there is a floating selection, many actions are impossible
      until the floating section is anchored.
      To check, look at the
      <link linkend="gimp-layer-dialog">Layers Dialog</link>, shortcut
      <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>L</keycap></keycombo> (making sure
      it's set to the image you're working on) and see whether the top layer
      is called <quote>Floating Selection</quote>.

    <para>
      <emphasis>How to solve:</emphasis>
      Right click on the floating selection to open the Layer menu and
      select either <guimenuitem>Anchor Layer</guimenuitem>
      (shortcut <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>H</keycap></keycombo>)
      to anchor the floating selection to the layer below it, or convert it
      into an ordinary layer by selecting <guimenuitem>To New Layer
      </guimenuitem> (shortcut <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap>
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>N</keycap></keycombo>).

      If this is the problem, merely reading this will already have made
      you realize it, probably, but to explain in any case: sometimes
      the flickering line that outlines the selection is annoying
      because it makes it hard to see important details of the image, so
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> gives you the option of hiding the selection,
      by unchecking
      <guimenuitem>Show Selection</guimenuitem>
      in the <guimenu>View</guimenu>
      menu. It is easy to forget that you have done this, though.

          If you can't see any selection, there may be a very small one, or
          it is outside the visible area on your screen, or it can even be one

          the selected area will be clear and the unselected area will be masked.

          <quote>Invert</quote> in the <guimenu>Select</guimenu> menu (after

      This does not change the solution, though.

      issues</ulink> (also check the closed issues, fixed issues get closed even

      please open a new issue, making sure to give us all details like your
      Operating System, GIMP version, what tool or filter you were using and
      what exactly happened. Adding a screenshot, or uploading the image
