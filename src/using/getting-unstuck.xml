    All right, okay: you're stuck.  You're trying to use one of the
    tools on an image, and nothing is happening, and nothing you try
    makes any difference.  Your fists are starting to clench, and your
    face is starting to feel warm.  Are you going to have to kill the
    program, and lose all your work?  This sucks!

  <para lang="en">
    Well, hold on a second.  This happens pretty frequently, even to
    people who've used the GIMP for a long time, but generally the
    cause is not so hard to figure out (and fix) if you know what to
    look at. Lets be calm, and go through a checklist that will
    probably get you GIMPing happily again.

            the problem, merely reading this will already have made
            you realize it, probably, but to explain in any case:
            sometimes the flickering line that outlines the selection
            is annoying because it makes it hard to see important
            details of the image, so Gimp gives you the option of
            hiding the selection, by unchecking <guimenuitem>Show
            Selection</guimenuitem> in the
            <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.  It is easy to forget that
            you have done this, though.

            <emphasis role='bold'>How to fix:</emphasis> If doing this
            has destroyed a selection that you wanted to keep, hit
            Ctrl-Z (undo) a couple of times to restore it, and then
            we'll figure out what the problem is.  There are a couple
            of possibilities.  If you couldn't see any selection,
            there may have been a very tiny one, or even one that
            contained no pixels.  If this was the case, it surely is
            not a selection that you wanted to keep, so why have you
            gotten this far in the first place?  If you can see a
            selection but thought you were inside it, it might be
            inverted from what you think.  The easiest way to tell is
            to hit the Quick Mask button:  the selected area will be
            clear and the unselected area will be masked.  If this was
            the problem, then you can solve it by toggling Quick Mask
            off and choosing Invert in the <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
            menu.
