Wilber.xcf.gz.README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Wilber, the GIMP Mascot.

GIMP is an image manipulation program, see
http://www.gimp.org for more details.

The use of Wilber.xcf.gz is free, though it would be kind of you to mention 
the original author (Tuomas Kuosmanen <tigert@gimp.org>) somewhere.

Enjoy.
