    <title>Intention</title>
    <para>
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym>  is a powerful image editing program with many
    options and tools. However, it is also well suited for smaller tasks. The
    following tutorials are meant for those who want to achieve these common
    tasks without having to learn all the intricacies of <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
    and computer graphics in general.</para>
    <para>Hopefully, these tutorials will not only help you with your current
    task, but also get you ready to learn more complex tools and methods later,
    when you have the time and inspiration.</para>
    
    <para>All you need to know to start this tutorial, is how to find and open
    your image. ( 
    <menuchoice moreinfo="none">

    <para>You have a huge image, possibly from a digital camera, and you want
    to resize it so that it displays nicely on a web page, online board or
    email message.</para>

    </figure>
    
    <para>The first thing that you might notice after opening the image, is
    that 
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> opens the image at a logical size for viewing. If
    your image is very large, like the sample image, 
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> sets the zoom so that it displays nicely on the
    screen. The zoom level is shown in the status area at the bottom of the
    Image window. This does not change the actual image.</para>
    
    <para>The other thing to look at in the title-bar is the mode. If the mode
    shows as RGB in the title bar, you are fine. If the mode says <guilabel>
    Indexed</guilabel> or <guilabel>Grayscale</guilabel>, read the

      <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Scale Image</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice> to open the <quote>Scale Image</quote> dialog. You can right 
    click on the
    image to open the menu, or use the menu along the top of the Image window.
    Notice that the <quote>Scale Image</quote> menu item contains three dots, 
    which is a hint that a dialog will be opened.</para>

      <title>Dialog for Image Scaling in Pixels</title>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    
    <para>The unit of size for the purpose of displaying an image on a screen
    is the pixel. You can see the dialog has two sections: one for 
    <guilabel moreinfo="none">width</guilabel> and 
    <guilabel moreinfo="none">height</guilabel> and another for 
    <guilabel moreinfo="none">resolution</guilabel>. Resolution applies to
    printing only and has no effect on the image's size when it is displayed on
    a monitor or a mobile device. The reason is that different devices have
    different pixels sizes and so, an image that displays on one device (such
    as a smartphone) with a certain physical size, might display on other
    devices (such as an LCD projector) in another size altogether. For the
    purpose of displaying an image on a screen, you can ignore the resolution
    parameter. For the same reason, do not use any size unit other than the
    pixel in the height / width fields.</para>
    
    <para>If you know the desired width, enter it in the dialog at the top
    where it says 
    <guilabel moreinfo="none">Width</guilabel>. This is shown in the figure
    above. If you don't have such a number in mind, choose an appropriate width
    for the desired use. Common screen sizes range between 320 pixels for
    simpler phones, 1024 pixels for a netbook, 1440 for a wide-screen PC
    display and 1920 pixels for an HD screen. for the purpose of displaying an
    image on-line, a width of 600 to 800 pixels offers a good
    compromise.</para>
    
    <para>When you change one of the image's dimensions, 
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> changes the other dimension proportionally. To
    change the other dimension, see 
    <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-crop" />. Bear in mind that when you
    change the two dimensions arbitrarily, the image might become stretched or
    squashed.</para>

    <para>As discussed before, pixels don't have a set size in the real world.
    When you set out to print an image on paper, 
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> needs to know how big each pixels is. We use a
    parameter called resolution to set the ratio between pixels and real-world
    units such as inches.</para>
    <para>By default, most images open with the resolution set to 72. This
    number was chosen for historical reasons as it was the resolution of
    screens in the past, and means that when printed, every pixel is 1/72 of an
    inch wide. When printing images are taken with modern digital cameras, this
    produces very large but chunky images with visible pixels. What we want to
    do is tell <acronym>GIMP</acronym> to print it with the size we have in 
    mind, but not alter the pixel data so as not to lose quality.</para>
    
    <para>To change the print size use 
    <menuchoice moreinfo="none">
      <guimenu moreinfo="none">Image</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Print Size</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice> to open the <quote>Print Size</quote> dialog. Select a size 
    unit you are comfortable with, such as <quote>inches</quote>. Set one 
    dimension, and let  <acronym>GIMP</acronym> change the other one 
    proportionally. Now examine the change in resolution. If the resolution is 
    300 pixels per Inch or over, the printed image's quality will be very high 
    and pixels will not be noticeable. With a resolution of between 200 and 
    150 ppi, pixels will be somewhat noticeable, but the image will be fine as 
    long as its not inspected too closely. Values lower than 100 are visibly 
    coarse and should only be used for material that is seen from a distance, 
    such as signs or large posters.</para>

    <para>If you have images that take up a large space on disk, you can reduce
    that space even without changing the image dimensions. The best image
    compression is achieved by using the <acronym>JPG</acronym> format, but 
    even if the image is already in this format, you can usually still make it 
    take up less space, as the JPG format has an adaptive compression 
    scheme that allows saving in varying levels of compression. The trade-off 
    is that the less space an image takes, the more detail from the original 
    image you lose. You should also be aware that repeated saving in the JPG 
    format causes more and more image degradation.

      Since GIMP-2.8, images are loaded and saved as .XCF files. Your JPG

    <para>
      The dialog opens with the file name already typed in the Name box, with 
      the default.png extension. Delete the existing extension and type JPG 
      instead, and <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will determine the file type from 
      the file extension. Use the file extension list, red circled in the 
      figure above, to see the types supported by <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. 
      The supported extensions change depending on your installed libraries. 
      If <acronym>GIMP</acronym> complains, or if <quote>JPEG</quote> is 
      grayed out in the Extensions menu, cancel out of everything and step 
      through the <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-change-mode" />. Once 
      you have done this, click <guibutton>Save</guibutton>. This opens the 
      <quote>Export Image as JPEG</quote> dialog that contains the quality 
      control.
    </para>
    
    <para>The <quote>Export Image as JPEG</quote> dialog uses default values that 
    reduce size in memory while retaining good visual quality; this is the safest 
    and quickest thing to do.</para>

    <para>Reduce the image <guilabel>Quality</guilabel> to make the image even 
    smaller. Reduced quality degrades the image, so be certain to check 
    <quote>Show preview in image window</quote> to visually gauge the
    degradation. A <guilabel>Quality</guilabel> setting of 10 produces a very 
    poor quality image that uses very little disk space. The figure below shows 
    a more reasonable image. A quality of 75 produces a reasonable image using 
    much less disk space, which will, in turn, load much faster on a web page. 
    Although the image is somewhat degraded, it is acceptable for the intended 
    purpose.</para>

    <para>
    <emphasis>RGB</emphasis>- This is the default mode, used for high-quality
    images, and able to display millions of colors. This is also the mode for
    most of your image work including scaling, cropping, and even flipping. In
    RGB mode, each pixel consists of three different components: R-&gt;Red,
    G-&gt;Green, B-&gt;Blue. Each of these in turn can have an intensity value
    of 0-255. What you see at every pixel is an additive combination of these
    three components.</para>
    
    <para>
    <emphasis>Indexed</emphasis>- This is the mode usually used when file size
    is of concern, or when you are working with images with few colors. It
    involves using a fixed number of colors (256 or less) for the entire image
    to represent colors. By default, when you change an image to a palleted
    image, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> generates an <quote>optimum palette</quote> 
    to best represent your image.</para>

    <para>As you might expect, since the information needed to represent the
    color at each pixel is less, the file size is smaller. However, sometimes,
    there are options in the various menus that are grayed-out for no apparent
    reason. This usually means that the filter or option cannot be applied when
    your image is in its current mode. Changing the mode to RGB, as outlined
    above, should solve this issue. If RGB mode doesn't work either, perhaps
    the option you're trying requires your layer to have the ability to be
    transparent. This can be done just as easily via 
    <menuchoice moreinfo="none">
      <guimenu moreinfo="none">Layer</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Transparency</guimenuitem>

    <emphasis>Grayscale</emphasis>- Grayscale images have only shades of gray.
    This mode has some specific uses and takes less space on the hard drive in
    some formats, but is not recommended for general use as reading it is not
    supported by many applications.</para>
    
    <para>There is no need to convert an image to a specific mode before saving
    it in your favorite format, as <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is smart enough to

    <para>Sometimes you need to separate the subject of an image from its
    background. You may want to have the subject on a flat color, or keep the
    background transparent so you can use it on an existing background, or any
    other thing you have in mind. To do this, you must first use 
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s selection tools to draw a selection around your
    subject. This is not an easy task, and selecting the correct tool is
    crucial. You have several tools to accomplish this.</para>
    <para>The <quote>Free Select Tool</quote> allows you to draw a border 
    using either freehand or straight lines. Use this when the subject has a 
    relatively simple shape. Read more about this tool here:

    distinct enough against its current background. Read more about this tool
