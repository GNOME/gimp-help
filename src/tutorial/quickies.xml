    <para>
      So, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is installed on your computer, you need to
      make a quick 
      change to an image for some project, but don't want to learn about
      computer graphics just to change an image; totally understandable.
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is a powerful image manipulator with many
      options and tools. However, it is quick and somewhat intuitive (after a
      time) for the small jobs as well. Hopefully, these quickies will help
      you with your quick problem and help you to stay friends with The
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>;
      and ready for the more complex tools and methods later, when you have
      the time and inspiration.

    <para>
      A couple of words about the images used here. The images came from APOD
      <xref linkend="bibliography-online-apod01"/>,
      Astronomy Picture of the Day. The screenshots were taken on my desktop
      which is sporting this APOD
      <xref linkend="bibliography-online-apod02"/> image.

      All you need to know to start this tutorial, is how to find and open
      your image.

      Problem: you have a huge image and you want to resize the is so
      that it will display nicely on a web page. The example image is this

      The first thing that you might notice, is that
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> opens the image at a logical size for
      viewing. If your image is really big like the sample image,
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will set the zoom so that
      it will display nicely on the screen. The zoom level is shown in the
      status area at the bottom of the Image window.

      The other thing to look at in the title-bar is the mode.
      If the mode shows as RGB in the title bar, you are fine.
      If the mode says Indexed or grayscale,

      smaller than 4x6 rather than bigger). You can see this dialog above.

      Let <acronym>GIMP</acronym> choose the other dimension length for you.
      Meaning, it requires

      change the rest. To change

      I usually type the full filename with extension into Name text box,

      circled in the figure above, to see the types supported by
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. The supported extensions change depending
      on your installed libraries.

      Reduce the image Quality to make the image even smaller.
      Reduced quality degrades the image, so be certain to check
      <quote>Show preview in image window</quote>. As shown in the figure
      above, a Quality of 6 produces a very poor quality image that uses very
      little disk space.
      The figure below shows a more reasonable image. A quality of 42
      produces a reasonable image using much less disk space, which will,
      in turn, load much faster on a web page. Although the image is degraded,
      it is acceptable for the intended purpose.

      There are many reasons to crop an image; for example, fitting an image
      to fill a frame, removing a portion of the background to emphasize the
      subject, etc. There are two methods to activate the crop tool. 
      Click the

        <guimenuitem>Crop</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      in the image window. This will change the cursor and allow you to click
      and drag a rectangular shape. The
      button in the toolbox is the nicest way to get to any of the tools. I
      have chosen one of the huge and beautiful APOD images

      After completing the click and drag motion, a rectangle with special
      regions show the selected area. As the cursor is moved over the
      different areas of the selected crop area, the cursor changes.
      You can then drag the cursor to change the dimensions of the selected
      area. As shown in the figure above, as the crop area is resized,
      the dimensions and ratio are shown in the status bar.
      See <xref linkend="gimp-tool-crop"/> for more information on cropping
      in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>.
      If you would like to make
      this rectangular image square, you should find the width and height from
      the Get Image Information Quickie (see
      <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-info"/>. Use the smallest of the
      two lengths to determine the size of the square. In my 300 x 225 pixel
      image, the largest square I can get is 225 x 225 pixels.
      Use the image and the
      squares to get the best part of the image for the area.
      Use any of the areas to move the edges and change the dimensions
      to achieve the image that you prefer. Double click in the area
      to crop the image.

      it is fast and easy to find the smallest dimension. 
      you need only to open the dialog and find the lesser length and use

      It is nice to have images appear on a browser window as a photo would.
      Photos online appear to be 4x6 inches when scaled to 288x432 pixels (72
      dpi for many monitors). There is a problem, however, if you try to scale
      this image. The ratio of width to length of the original does not match
      the ratio of the photo. So, to make the scaled image the correct size
      some pixels must be cropped from the height. The final image will
      <quote>appear</quote> as a 6x4 inch photo on many monitors.

      There are problems when mixing scanned photos, digital
      photos, and scanned negatives. Many film developing machines
      automatically crop portions of the image so that they will match
      the printing size, or a certain style.
      If you are preparing an image to be printed on a machine like
      this; or if you are planning on a gallery where the images are from
      different sources, some intelligent cropping to fit the best size for
      the medium you have chosen will be a plus. If this is confusing; please
      blame the photo printing industry and not <acronym>GIMP</acronym>.

      You can change the Resolution of your image as well, using the same
      methods we used to Scale the image, although, in my somewhat limited
      use,
      the issue is more about how many pixels. Let's say you want to print an
      image at a photo lab. 300 pixels for every inch is preferred.
      An image that is 2241x1548 pixels will easily print as
      a 7 x 5 photo. 2241px/300ppi =
      7.47 in. Get your calculator for the short side. 1548/300 = _.

      There is another brutal fact you should come to terms with if you are
      new to graphics and computers. Just because it looks good on the screen
      doesn't mean that it will print nicely. I tried to emulate how this
      image would appear printed at 300dpi. Sorry. There are some options, for
      instance my friend printed images and then scanned them back in.
      Terrible business!

      As with anything else, images come in different kinds and serve
      different purposes. Sometimes, a small size is important (for web sites)
      and at other times, retaining a high color depth in all its glory (a
      family portrait) is what you want. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> can handle
      all of this, and
      more, primarily by converting between three fundamental modes, as seen
      in this menu. In order to switch your image to one of these modes, you
      open it and follow that menu and click the mode you want.

      <emphasis>RGB</emphasis>
      - This is the default mode, used for high quality rich color images.
      This is also the mode for most of your image work including
      scaling, cropping, and even flipping, as it gives the computer more
      information to work with. The extra information also makes RGB Mode the
      largest to store as a result.
    </para>
    <para>
      A little bit of detail if you are interested. Each pixel or point when
      in this mode consists of three different components. R-&gt;Red, G-&gt;Green,
      B-&gt;Blue. Each of these in turn can have an intensity value of 0-255. So,
      at every pixel, what you see is an additive combination of these three
      components. All these combinations result in a way to represent millions
      of colors.

      <emphasis>Indexed</emphasis>
      - This is the mode usually used when file size is of concern, or when
      you are working with images with few colors. It involves using a fixed
      number of colors, 256 or less, at each point to represent the color at
      that point. The defaults to attempting to figure out an "optimum
      palette" to best represent your image. Try it, you can undo it if you
      don't like the results, or use a custom palette or more colors.

    <para>
      As you might expect, since the information needed to represent the
      color at each pixel is less, the file size is smaller. However,
      sometimes, there are options in the various menus that are
      "greyed" out for no apparent reason. This usually means that the filter
      or option cannot be applied when your image is in its current mode.
      Changing the mode to RGB, as outlined above, should solve this issue. If
      RGB mode 
      doesn't work either, perhaps the option you're trying requires your
      layer to have the ability to be transparent. This can be done just as
      easily via
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Layer</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Transparency</guimenuitem>
        <guimenuitem>Add Alpha Channel</guimenuitem>

      <emphasis>Grayscale</emphasis>
      - In case you want to convert your brilliant color image to something
      that's black and white (with a lot of shades of grey), this is one of
      the easiest ways in which to do it. Some photos do look a lot fancier
      when displayed in grayscale. Again, if you're interested in some detail,
      this is achieved by taking the RGB values at the pixels in your image,
      and suitably weighted averaging them to get an intensity at that point.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is no need to convert an image to a specific mode before saving it
      in your favourite format, as <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is smart enough to
      properly export the image.

      The tool used as is (the default) will simply flip the image at its
      vertical axis. If you double click on the button,the tool options dialog
      will open, if it is not already displayed in the dock under the toolbox.
      Use the options dialog to switch between horizontal and vertical. You
      can also use the 
      <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key to switch between horizontal and vertical.
      All possible flips are displayed in this page.
