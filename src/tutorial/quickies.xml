      So, you have GIMP installed on your computer, you need to make a quick
      change to an image for some project, but don't want to learn about
      computer graphics right now in order to get the image changed. Totally
      understandable. GIMP is a powerful image manipulator with many
      options and tools. However, it is quick and somewhat intuitive (after a
      time) for the small jobs as well. Hopefully, these quickies will help
      you with your quick problem and help you to stay friends with The GIMP
      and ready for its more complex tools and methods later, when you have
      the time and inspiration.

      Problem: you have a huge image and you want to put it nicely for viewing
      on a web page. The GIMP is a quick solution. Our example image is this
      beauty m51_hallas_big.jpg from APOD
      <xref linkend="bibliography-online-apod03"/>.

    <para>
      The first thing that you might notice is that The GIMP opens the image
      at a logical size for viewing. So, if your image is really big (like the
      sample image) it will display it zoomed out until it fits nicely. You
      can tell if GIMP has done this by the percentage number in the title
      bar. Just because it looks right in this <quote>View</quote> doesn't
      mean anything.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <para>
      The other thing to look at in the title-bar is the mode. If it says RGB
      in the title bar, you are fine. If it says Indexed or grayscale there,
      you should read the <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-change-mode"/>.

      Perhaps you want your image to look more like a 4x6 inch photo on most
      image rendering web browsers. Simply switch the units to
      <quote>inches</quote> and put 4 inches in the height box (opting for
      smaller than 4x6 rather than bigger). You can see this dialog above.

      Let GIMP choose the other dimension length for you. Meaning, it will
      take more image knowledge to change both width and height and have it
      look correct. So only change one and let GIMP change the rest. To change
      the other length see <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-crop"/>.

      You can make your jpegs smaller without changing the pixel width of the
      image. Actually you can change the weight of the image a lot. I used
      an(other) image from APOD <xref linkend="bibliography-online-apod04"/>.
      The original image is huge (3000 pixels wide) so I also made a smaller
      (pixel width) image available. To prepare this image for the web, you
      should first reduce the image to a better width and height for web
      viewing as described in the
      <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-scale"/>.
      Right click on the properly scaled image and follow the menus
      <menuchoice moreinfo="none">
        <guimenu moreinfo="none">File</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Save As...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      at the image window. The Save Dialog will pop up.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <para>
      I generally type the filename I want into the text box, but the
      Extension drop menu can tell you the available file formats (depending
      on the libraries you have installed and the conditions of the image you
      are trying to save). If The GIMP complains right now, or if
      <quote>JPEG</quote> is grayed out in the Extensions menu you should just
      cancel out of everything and step through the
      <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-change-mode"/>.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    

    <para>
      In the JPEG Save Dialog, you can opt for The GIMP defaults which reduce
      the size quite a bit, without hurting the visual quality in a way that I
      can detect. This would be the safest and quickest thing to do.

    <!--<para lang="fr">
      Dans la fenêtre de Dialogue de Sauvegarde en JPEG, vous pouvez opter
      pour les valeurs par défaut du GIMP qui ne réduiront que très peu le

      If you would like to make it smaller still, make sure that the
      <quote>Preview</quote> toggle is on and then watch the image area and
      change the compression level by moving the <quote>Quality</quote>
      slider down. You can see the quality of the image changing, especially
      towards the leftmost end of the slider. Above is a screenshot of me
      doing this very thing. As you can see, very small is also very bad. I
      have a screenshot of me setting the Quality slider to a more acceptable
      level below.

      We will have to change all of the numbers. If you would like to make
      this rectangular image square, you should find the width and height from
      the Get Image Information Quickie (see
      <xref linkend="gimp-tutorial-quickie-info"/>. Use the smallest of the
      two lengths to determine the size of the square. In my 300 x 225 pixel
      image, the largest square I can get is 225 x 225 pixels, and I will need
      to make sure the Y origin is 0. At that point, I use the image and the
      squares to get the best part of the image for the area. The upper right
      and lower left crop squares will move the marked area. The other two
      (upper left and lower right) will change the dimensions of the marked
      area, so be careful. I have a screenshot of this, right after I fixed
      the width and height and the Y origin, but before the final positioning.
      The arrows show the move points.  I decided that the image looked the
      best with the X Origin at 42.

      you need only to open the dialog and find the lesser length and use

      It is nice to have images appear on a browser window as a photo would.
      Photos online appear to be 4x6 inches when scaled to 288x432 pixels (72
      dpi for many monitors). There is a problem, however, if you try to scale
      this image. The ratio of width to length of the original does not match
      the ratio of the photo. So, to make the scaled image the correct size
      crop 10 pixels from the height. For the sample image, it was best to
      crop 10 pixels off from the top. The final image should
      <quote>appear</quote> as a 6x4 inch photo on most monitors.

      There will be problems whenever mixing scanned photos with digital
      photos and also with scanned negatives. Modern film developing machines
      automatically crop one half of an inch off from each image -- the rumor
      is that the photo printing machines match a certain style of camera
      view. If you are preparing an image to be printed on a machine like
      this; or if you are planning on a gallery where the images are from
      different sources, some intelligent cropping to fit the best size for
      the medium you have chosen will be a plus. If this is confusing; please
      blame the photo printing industry and not GIMP.

      You can change the Resolution of your image as well, using the same
      methods as we used in the Scale, although, in my somewhat limited use,
      the issue is more about how many pixels. Let's say you want to get this
      image printed at the photo lab. 300 pixels for every inch is preferred.
      This original image will print easily as a 7 x 5 photo. 2241px/300ppi =
      7.47 in. Get out your calculator for the short side. 1548/300 = _.

      There is another brutal fact you should come to terms with if you are
      new to graphics and computers. Just because it looks good on the screen
      doesn't mean that it will print that nicely. I tried to emulate how this
      image would appear printed at 300dpi. Sorry. There are some options, for
      instance my friend printed images and then scanned them back in.
      Terrible business!

    <para>
      As with anything else, images come in different kinds and serve
      different purposes. Sometimes, a small size is important (for web sites)
      and at other times, retaining a high colour depth in all its glory (a
      family portrait) is what you want. GIMP can handle all of this, and
      more, primarily by converting between three fundamental modes, as seen
      in this menu. In order to switch your image to one of these modes, you
      open it and follow that menu and click the mode you want.

    <para>
      <emphasis>RGB</emphasis>
      - This is the default mode, used for high quality rich colour images.
      This is also the mode to do most of your image work with including
      scaling, cropping and even flipping as it gives the computer more
      information to work with. This extra information also makes RGB Mode the
      largest to store as a result.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <para>
      A little bit of detail if you are interested. Each pixel or point when
      in this mode consists of three different components. R-&gt;Red, G-&gt;Green,
      B-&gt;Blue. Each of these in turn can have an intensity value of 0-255. So,
      at every pixel, what you see is an additive combination of these three
      components. All these combinations result in a way to represent millions
      of colours.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <para>
      As an example to practice with images have been provided in various
      sizes and formats. Indexed images of different sizes: from a very old
      APOD a small gif and a larger gif of the same image from a later APOD.
      Also the same image in RGB as provided by Earth Observatory a smaller
      version and a huge version.

    <para>
      <emphasis>Indexed</emphasis>
      - This is the mode usually used when file size is of concern, or when
      you are working with images with few colours. It involves using a fixed
      number of colours, 256 or less, at each point to represent the colour at
      that point. The defaults to attempting to figure out an "optimum
      palette" to best represent your image. Try it, you can undo it if you
      don't like the results, or use a custom palette or more colours.

    <para>
      As you might expect, since the information needed to represent the
      colour at each pixel is less, the file size is a lot smaller. However,
      sometimes, there will be options in the various menus that seem to have
      been "greyed" out for no apparent reason. This usually means the filter
      or option cannot be applied when your image is in its current mode.
      Changing the mode to RGB as outlined above should solve this issue. If
      that doesn't work either, perhaps the option you're trying requires your
      layer to have the ability to be transparent. This can be done just as
      easily via (Image)-&gt;Layer-&gt;Transparency-&gt;Add Alpha Channel.

    <para>
      <emphasis>Grayscale</emphasis>
      - In case you want to convert your brilliant colour image to something
      that's black and white (with a lot of shades of grey), this is one of
      the easiest ways in which to do it. Some photos do look a lot fancier
      when displayed in grayscale. Again, if you're interested in some detail,
      this is achieved by taking the RGB values at the pixels in your image,
      and suitably weighted averaging them to get an intensity at that point.
    </para>
    
    
    
    
    
    

    <para>
      There is no need to convert an image to a specific mode before saving it
      in your favourite format, as GIMP is smart enough to export.
