  <para>
    The Dashboard helps to monitor GIMP resource usage (Cache, Swap, CPU,
    Memory). This allows you to make more educated decisions about various
    configuration options, especially
    <link linkend="gimp-prefs-system-resources">System Resources</link>.
    It is also used by developers.

    <title>Using the Dashboard</title>
    <para>
      The Dashboard consists of five groups that you can monitor:
      <guilabel>Cache</guilabel> usage, <guilabel>Swap</guilabel> usage,
      <guilabel>CPU</guilabel> usage, <guilabel>Memory</guilabel> usage, and
      <guilabel>Misc</guilabel> information. By default the
      Misc group is hidden and the CPU and Memory groups are collapsed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each group has a separate <link linkend="tab-menus">Tab menu</link>
      where you can change settings related to that group.
    </para>
    <para>
      At the bottom of the Dashboard are two buttons, which will be explained
      in the Dashboard context menu, where these commands are also available.

            This context menu allows you to change what groups are visible,

                  This allows you to start or stop recording a performance log.
                  In certain situations the developers may ask you to supply this
                  log if you are experiencing performance related issues. This
                  log can help them to figure out the problem.
                  When you start recording you will be asked to select a
                  location and filename where the log will be saved.

                <para>
                  If you are recording a performance log, this enables you to
                  mark a certain event in the log. You will be asked to give a
                  name to this event. This can make it easier for developers to
                  find the problem area in your log, because logs can become
                  fairly large.
                  This is also available as a button at the bottom of the
                  Dashboard when you are recording a performance log.

                  If you are recording a performance log, this enables you to
                  mark a certain point in the log. An empty marker will be
                  added, meaning you won't be asked to give it a name. This can
                  make it easier for developers to find the problem area in your
                  log, because logs can become fairly large.
                  When you are recording you can also use the button at the
                  bottom of the Dashboard while pressing the
                  <keycap>Shift</keycap> key to add an empty marker.
