    This page allows you to set the locations for two important folders used
    by GIMP for temporary files. The pages below it allow you to customize the
    locations searched for resources such as brushes etc.; see
    <link linkend="gimp-prefs-folders-data">Data Folders</link>
    for a description that applies to them. You can change the folders here by
    editing the entries, or by pressing the buttons on the right to bring up a
    file chooser window.

        <para>
          This folder is used for temporary files: files created for temporary
          storage of working data, and then deleted within the same GIMP
          session. It does not require a lot of space or high performance. By
          default, a subdirectory called <filename>tmp</filename>
          in your personal GIMP directory is used, but if that disk is very
          cramped for space, or has serious performance issues, you can change
          it to a different directory. The directory must exist and be
          writable by you, or bad things will happen.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          This is the folder used as a <quote>memory bank</quote> when the
          total size of images and data open in GIMP exceeds the available
          RAM. If you work
          with very large images, or images with many layers, or have many
          images open at once, GIMP can potentially require hundreds of
          megabytes of swap space, so available disk space and performance are
          definitely things to think about for this folder. By default, it is
          set to your personal GIMP directory, but if you have another disk
          with more free space, or substantially better performance, you may
          see a significant benefit from moving your swap folder there. The
          directory must exist and be writable by you.
