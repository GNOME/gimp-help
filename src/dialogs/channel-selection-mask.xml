    Channels can be used to save and restore your selections. Clicking on the
    <guilabel>Quick mask</guilabel> button on the
    <link linkend="gimp-image-window">Image window</link>
    automatically creates a new channel called <guilabel>Qmask</guilabel>
    and saves the displayed active selection to a thumbnail in front of the
    channel.There are many selection tools in GIMP like rectangular
    selection tool or fuzzy selection for continuous selections. Selection
    Masks are a graphical way to build selections into a gray level channel
    where white pixels are selected and black pixels are not selected.
    Therefore gray pixels are partially selected. You can think of them as
    feathering the selection, a smooth transition between selected and not
    selected. This is important to avoid the ugly pixelization effect when you
    fill the selection or when you erase its content after isolating a subject
    from background.

          There are several ways to initialize a selection mask.  From the
          image window menu
          <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Save to Channel</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice>
          if there is an active selection.  From the image window
          the bottom-left button creates a <link linkend="gimp-qmask">Quick
            Mask</link>; the content will be initialized with the active
          selection.  From the channel dialog, when you click on the
          <guilabel>New channel</guilabel> button or from the context menu.
          When created, this Selection mask appears in the Channel dialog,
          named <quote>Selection mask copy</quote> with a queuing number.
          You can change this by using the context menu that you get by
          right-clicking on the channel.

      Once the channel is initialized, selected (highlighted in blue), visible
      (eye-icon in the dialog), and displayed as you want (color and opacity
      attributes), you can start to work with all the paint tools. The colors
      used are important. If you paint with some color other than white, grey,
      or black, the color Value (luminosity) will be used to define a gray
      (medium, light, or dark). When your mask is painted, you can transform
      it to a selection by clicking on the
      <guilabel>Channel to selection</guilabel>
      button or from the context menu.

      You can work in selection masks not only with the paint tool but also
      with other tools. For instance, you can use the selection tools to fill
      areas uniformly with gradients or patterns. By adding many selection
      masks in your list you can easily compose very complex selections. One
      can say that a selection mask is to a selection as a layer is to an
      image.

        As long as a selection mask is activated you are working in the mask
        and not in the image. To work in the image you have to deactivate all
        selection masks. Don't forget also to stop displaying masks in the
        image by removing the eye icon. Check also that all RGB and Alpha
        channels are activated and displayed in the image.
