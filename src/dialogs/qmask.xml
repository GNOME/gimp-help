  <para>
    A <guilabel>Quick Mask</guilabel> is a
    <link linkend="dialogs-selection-masks">Selection Mask</link>
    intended to be used temporarily to paint a selection. Temporarily means
    that, unlike a normal selection mask, it will be deleted from the
    channel list after its transformation to selection. The
    <link linkend="gimp-tools-selection">selection tools</link>
    sometimes show their limits when they have to be used for doing complex
    drawing selection, as progressive. In this case, using the QuickMask is a
    good idea which can give very good results.

    <para>
      To initialize a <guilabel>Quick Mask</guilabel>,
      click the bottom-left button in the image window. If a selection was
      active in your image, then its content appears unchanged while the
      border is covered with a translucent red color. If no selection was
      active then all the image is covered with a translucent red color. At
      every moment you can hide the mask by clicking on the eye icon
      <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../images/dialogs/stock-eye-20.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>
      in front of the <guilabel>QMask</guilabel>.
      From the channel dialog you can double click on the name or the
      thumbnail to edit the <guilabel>QMask</guilabel>
      attributes. Then you can change the <guilabel>Opacity</guilabel>
      and its filling color. Once a quick mask is initialized click on it to
      be sure it is selected and blue highlighted in the list, and start to
      paint on it with any GIMP paint tool. The mask is coded in gray tones,
      so you must use white or gray to decrease the area limited by the mask
      and black to increase it. The area painted in light or dark gray will
      be transition areas for the selection like feathering. When your mask
      is ready, click again on the bottom-left button in the image window and
      the quick mask will be removed from the channel list and converted to
      a selection. Quick mask's purpose is to paint a selection and its
      transitions with the paint tools without worrying about managing
      selection masks. It's a good way to isolate a subject in a picture
      because once the selection is made you only have to remove its content
      (or inverse if the subject is in the selection).

          Screenshot of the image window with activated QuickMask. The

          The QuickMask is now disabled and a selection is initialised from
          the QuickMask, which was filled by a gradient before. You see the
          selection borders in the middle of the image.

          A stroke is now added during the enabled selection. The key is,
          that the black color will have no opacity of the resulting stroke
          (right) and white color will have a full opacity of the stroke
          (left).

      After the QuickMask Button is pressed, the command generates a
      temporary 8-bit (0-255) channel, on which the progressive selection
      work is stored. If a selection is already present the mask is
      initialized with the content of the selection. Once QuickMask has been
      activated, the image is covered by a red semi-transparent veil. This
      one represents the non-selected pixels. Any
      <link linkend="gimp-tools-paint">paint tool</link>
      can be used to create the selection on the QuickMask. They should use
      only greyscale color, conforming the channel properties, white enabling
      to define the future selected place. The selection will be displayed as
      soon as the QuickMask will be toggled but its temporary channel will
      not be available anymore.
