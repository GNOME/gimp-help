    <para>
      You can export your image in xwd format, which is short for <quote>X
      window dump</quote> format, when you choose the <quote>.xwd</quote> extension,
      or explicitly choose <quote>X window dump</quote> as file type in the
      export dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
