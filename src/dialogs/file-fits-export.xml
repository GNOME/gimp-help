    <para>
      You can export your image in fits format, which is short for
      <quote>Flexible Image Transport System</quote> format, when you choose
      the <quote>.fits</quote> extension, or explicitly choose
      <quote>Flexible Image Transport System</quote> as file type in the
      export dialog.
      This image format is commonly used for astronomical images.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
