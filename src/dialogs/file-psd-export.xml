    <para>
      Photoshop is a well known image editor. This export dialog allows you
      to export in Photoshop's native PSD format.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can export your image in this format when you choose the
      <quote>.psd</quote> extension, or explicitly choose <quote>Photoshop
      image</quote> as file type in the export dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some considerations when exporting to a PSD. Not all blending modes can
      be converted to an exact equivalent between <acronym>GIMP</acronym> and
      Photoshop. For many blending modes, the
      <link linkend="gimp-concepts-layer-modes-legacy">legacy layer
      modes</link> are closer to Photoshop's equivalents. However, legacy
      layer modes do not support setting the
      <link linkend="gimp-layer-composite-mode">composite mode</link>.
      Photoshop often uses the equivalent of our
      <guilabel>Clip to Backdrop</guilabel> composite mode. There it is called
      <quote>Blend Clipped Layers as Group</quote>. If you want to support
      that, you should not use legacy layer modes.
