  <para>
    When exporting an image, most file formats have additional options that
    can be set. If that is the case, a new dialog opens after you have selected
    the filename and export file format. The following pages document the
    dialogs for export file formats in alphabetical order.

  <para>
    Be aware that not all formats support all kinds of images. In particular
    certain formats may not be able to show transparency (like jpeg), while
    only a few formats support exporting an animation (like webp and gif).
