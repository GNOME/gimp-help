    <para>
      You can export your image in XPM format, which is short for <quote>X
      PixMap</quote> format, when you choose the <quote>.xpm</quote> extension,
      or explicitly choose <quote>X PixMap image</quote> as file type in the
      export dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      This format is a successor for the older
      <link linkend="file-xbm-export">X BitMap</link> format and supports
      color images. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> does not support setting an icon
      hot spot for this format.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
