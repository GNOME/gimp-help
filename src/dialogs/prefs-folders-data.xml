  <para>
    GIMP uses several types of resources – such as brushes, patterns,
    gradients, etc. – for which a basic set are supplied by GIMP when it is
    installed, and others can be created or downloaded by the user. For each
    such resource type, there is a Preference page that allows you to specify
    the <emphasis>search path</emphasis>:
    the set of directories from which items of the type in question are
    automatically loaded when GIMP starts. These pages all look very much the
    same: the page for brushes is shown above as an example.
  </para>
  <para>
    By default, the search path consists of two folders: a
    <emphasis>system</emphasis> folder, where items that are included
    with GIMP are placed, and a <emphasis>personal</emphasis> folder,
    inside your personal GIMP directory, where items added by you
    should be placed. The system folder should not be marked as
    writable, and you should not try to alter its contents. The
    personal folder must be marked as writable or it is useless,
    because there is nothing inside it except what you put there.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can customize the search path with the buttons at the top of
    the dialog.

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Select a Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click on one of the folders in the list, it is selected for
          whatever action comes next.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Add/Replace Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you type the name of a folder in the entry space, or navigate to
          it using the file chooser button
          <guiicon>
            <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/stock-icons/document-open.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
              </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
          </guiicon>
          on the right, and then click the left button, this will replace the
          selected folder with the one you have specified. If nothing in the
          list is selected, the folder will be added to the list.
        </para>
        <para>
          The icon to the left of the text entry area will change when the
          folder you have specified does not exist. GIMP will not create it
          for you, so you should do this yourself.
          Depending on the icon-theme you use, the icon mentioned above will
          change from green to red, or from thumbs-up to thumbs-down, to
          notify you of a non-existent folder.
        </para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Move Up/Down</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click on the up-arrow or down-arrow buttons, the selected
          folder will be changed to the following or preceding one in the
          list. Since the folders are read in order, using those buttons
          change the loading precedence of the items located in those folders.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Delete Folder</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you click on the button that shows the trash-can or X icon,
          depending on the icon theme used, the selected folder will be
          deleted from the list. Note that the folder itself is not affected;
          it is merely removed from the search path. Deleting the system folder
          is probably a bad idea, but nothing prevents you from doing it.
