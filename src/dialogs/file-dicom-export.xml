    <para>
      You can export your image in DICOM format, which is short for
      <quote>Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine</quote> format,
      when you choose the <quote>.dcm</quote> extension, or explicitly choose
      <quote>Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine image</quote> as
      file type in the export dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
