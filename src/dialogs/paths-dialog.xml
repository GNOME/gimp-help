    A <emphasis>path</emphasis> is a one-dimensional tracing, either
    polygonal, or curved, or a mixture of segments of both types.  In
    GIMP, the main uses of paths are either to form the boundaries of
    selections, or to be <emphasis>stroked</emphasis> to create
    visible curves on an image.  See the <link
    linkend='gimp-paths'>Paths</link> section for basic
    information on paths, and the <link linkend='gimp-tool-path'>Path
    Tool</link> section for information on how paths can be created
    and edited.

    The Paths dialog is used to manage paths, allowing you to create
    or delete them, save them, convert them to and from selections,
    etc.

    The Paths dialog is a dockable dialog; see the section on <link

    <title lang="en">Using the Paths dialog</title>

    <para lang='en'>
      Each path belongs to one image:  paths are components of images
      just like layers.  The Paths dialog shows you a list of all
      paths belonging to the currently active image:  switching images
      causes the dialog to show a different list of paths.  If the
      Paths dialog is embedded in a "Layers, Channels, and Paths"
      dock, you can see the name of the active image in the Image Menu
      at the top of the dock.  (Otherwise, you can add an Image Menu
      to the dock by choosing "Show Image Menu" from the Tab menu.)  
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      If you are familiar with the Layers dialog, you have a head
      start, because the Paths dialog is in several ways similar.  It
      shows a list of all paths that exist in the image, with four
      items for each path:

    <itemizedlist land='en'>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An "open eye" icon if the path is visible, or a blank space
          if it is not.  "Visible" means that a trace of the path is
          drawn on the image display.  The path is not actually shown
          in the image pixel data unless it has been stroked or
          otherwise rendered.  Clicking in the eye-symbol-space
          toggles the visibility of the path.

          eye-symbol-space if the path is transform-locked, or a blank
          space if it is not.  "Transform-locked" means that it forms
          part of a set of elements (layers, channels, etc) that are
          all affected in the same way by transformations (scaling,
          rotation, etc) applied to any one of them.  Clicking in the

      if the original path was visible.  Note that copying a visible

      this happens because paths are drawn in XOR mode, which has the
      curious property that drawing an item twice "undraws" it.  The

      "Selection to Path" creates a new path from the image's
      selection. In most cases the resulting path will closely follow
      the "marching ants" of the selection, but the correspondence
      will not usually be perfect.  Converting a two-dimensional
      selection mask into a one-dimensional path involves some rather
      tricky algorithms:  you can alter the way it is done using the
      "Advanced Options", which are accessed by holding down the Shift
      key while pressing the "Selection to Path" button at the bottom
      of the Paths dialog.  This brings up the Advanced Options
      dialog, which allows you to set 20 different options and
      variables, all with cryptic names.  The Advanced Options are
      really intended for developers only, and help with them goes
      beyond the scope of this documentation.  Generally speaking,
      "Selection to Path" will do what you expect it to, and you don't
      need to worry about how it is done (unless you want to).
