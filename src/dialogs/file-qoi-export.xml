    <para>
      You can export your image in qoi format, which is short for <quote>Quite
      OK Image</quote> format, when you choose the <quote>.qoi</quote>
      extension, or explicitly choose <quote>Quite OK Image</quote> as file
      type in the export dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
