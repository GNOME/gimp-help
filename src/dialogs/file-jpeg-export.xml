    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      JPEG files usually have an extension .jpg, .JPG, or .jpeg. It is a
      very widely used format, because it compresses images very
      efficiently, while minimizing the loss of image quality. No other
      format comes close to achieving the same level of compression. It does
      not, however, support transparency or multiple layers.

      The JPEG algorithm is quite complex, and involves a bewildering number
      of options, whose meaning is beyond the scope of this documentation.
      Unless you are a JPEG expert, the Quality parameter is probably the
      only one you will need to adjust.

          <para>
            When you save a file in JPEG format, a dialog is displayed
            that allows you to set the Quality level, which ranges from 0
            to 100. Values above 95 are generally not useful, though. The
            default quality of 85 usually produces excellent results, but
            in many cases it is possible to set the quality substantially
            lower without noticeably degrading the image. You can test the
            effect of different quality settings by checking
            <guilabel>Show Preview in image window</guilabel>
            in the JPEG dialog.
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Please note, that the numbers for the JPEG quality level have
              a different meaning in different applications.
              Saving with a quality level of 80 in GIMP is not
              necessarily comparable with saving with a quality level of
              80 in a different application.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            If a particular quality setting (or <quote>quantization
            table</quote>) was attached to the image when it was
            loaded, then this option allows you to use them instead of
            the standard ones.
          </para>
          <para>
            If you have only made a few changes to the image, then
            re-using the same quality setting will give you almost the
            same quality and file size as the original image. This
            will minimize the losses caused by the quantization step,
            compared to what would happen if you used different
            quality setting.
          </para>
          <para>
            If the quality setting found in the original file are not
            better than your default quality settings, then the option
            <quote>Use quality settings from original image</quote>
            will be available but not enabled. This ensures that you
            always get at least the minimum quality specified in your
            defaults. If you did not make major changes to the image
            and you want to save it using the same quality as the
            original, then you can do it by enabling this option.

            Checking this option causes each change in quality (or any other
            JPEG parameter) to be shown in the image display. (This does not
            alter the image: the image reverts back to its original state
            when the JPEG dialog is closed.)

                  JPG compression creates artifacts. By using this option,
                  you can smooth the image when saving, reducing them. But
                  your image becomes somewhat blurred.

                  With this option enabled, the image chunks are stored in
                  the file in an order that allows progressive image
                  refinement during a slow connection web download.
                  The progressive option for JPG has the same purpose as the
                  interlace option for GIF.
                  Unfortunately, the progressive option produces slightly
                  larger JPG files (than without the progressive option).

                    have been exported with the progressive setting enabled
                    (which is the default).

                  can be used in exporting as JPEG. Images
                  using arithmetic encoding can be 5 - 10 % smaller. But older
                  software may have trouble opening these images.

                  If you enable this option, the optimization of entropy
                  encoding parameters will be used. The result is typically
                  a smaller file, but it takes more time to generate.

                  The human eye is not sensitive in the same way over
                  the entire color spectrum. The compression
                  can use this to treat slightly different colors
                  that the eye perceives as very close, as identical
                  colors. The following methods are available:

                        contrasting colors, at the cost of not compressing
                        as well as the other methods.

                        This is the standard subsampling, which usually
                        provides a good ratio between image quality and file
                        size. There are situations, however, in which using no
                        subsampling (4:4:4) provides a noticeable increase in
                        the image quality; for example, when the image
                        contains fine details such as text over a uniform
                        background, or images with almost-flat colors.

                        This is similar to 4:2:2, but chroma is reduced in
                        the vertical direction.

                        This produces the smallest files. This suits images

                        the floating-point method may vary slightly across
                        machines, while the integer methods should give the
                        same results everywhere.
