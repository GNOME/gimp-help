          A transparency mask can be added to each layer, it's called Layer
          mask. A layer mask has the same size and same number of pixels as
          the layer to which it is attached. Every pixel of the mask can then
          be coupled with a pixel at the same location in the layer. The mask
          is a set of pixels in gray-tone on a value scale from 0 to 255. The
          pixels with a value 0 are black and give a full transparency to the
          coupled pixel in the layer. The pixels with a value 255 are white
          and give a full opacity to the coupled pixel in the layer.
        </para>
        <para>
          To create a layer mask start with a right click on the layer to call
          the context menu and select <guilabel>Add layer mask</guilabel>
          in the menu. A dialog appears where you can initialize the content of
          the mask:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>White (full opacity)</guilabel>:
              the mask is white
              in the Layer Dialog. So, all pixels of the layer are visible
              in the image window since painting the mask with white makes
              layer pixels fully visible. You will paint with black to make
              layer pixels transparent.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Black (full transparency)</guilabel>: the mask is
              black in the Layer Dialog. So, the layer is fully transparent
              since painting the mask with black makes layer pixels
              transparent. Painting with white will remove the mask and make
              layer pixels visible.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Layer's alpha channel</guilabel>: the mask is
              initialized according to the content of layer Alpha
              channel.  If the layer still contains transparency it's
              copied in the mask.

          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Transfer layer's alpha channel</guilabel>:
              Does the same thing as the previous option, except that it
              also resets the layer's alpha channel to full opacity.

            <para><guilabel>Channel</guilabel>: The layer mask is initialized
              with a selection mask you have created before, stored in the
              Channel dialog.

            <para><guilabel>Invert mask</guilabel> : This checkbox allows you to
              invert : black turns to white and white turns to black.

        <para>
          When the mask is created it appears as a thumbnail right to the
          layer thumbnail. By clicking alternatively on the layer and mask
          thumbnail you can enable one or other. The active item has a white
          border (which is not well visible around a white mask). That's an
          important point. Always keep the Layers Dialog prominently when
          working with masks, because you can't see, looking at the canvas,
          which of the layer or the mask is active.
        </para>
        <para>
          Pressing <keycap>Alt</keycap> (or
          <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap></keycombo>  and
          click on the layer mask thumbnail) is equivalent to the
          <link linkend="gimp-layer-mask-show">Show Layer Mask</link>
          command : the layer mask border turns to green. If you press
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> the border is red and the result is
          equivalent to the
          <link linkend="gimp-layer-mask-disable">Disable Layer Mask</link>
          command. To return to normal view redo last operation. These
          options are for greater convenience in your work.

                the blue layer. In the image window, the blue layer remains
                visible because a white mask makes layer pixels visible.
