    <para>
      You can export your image in cel format, which is short for
      <quote>KiSS cel</quote> format,
      when you choose the <quote>.cel</quote> extension, or explicitly choose
      <quote>KISS CEL</quote> as file type in the export dialog.
      This file format is used to create and display digital dress-up paper
      dolls.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are no settings to choose from. No export dialog will open after
      you have chosen your filename. It will automatically start the export.
