    The Brushes dialog is used to select a brush, for use with
    painting tools:  see the <link
    linkend='gimp-brushes'>Brushes</link> section for basic
    informmation on brushes and how they are used in GIMP.  The dialog
    also gives you access to several functions for 
    manipulating brushes.  You can select a brush by clicking on
    it in the list:  it will then be shown in the
    Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the Toolbox.  A few dozen basic
    brushes come pre-installed with GIMP, along with a few assorted
    bizarre ones that mainly serve to show you the range of
    possibilities.  You can also create custom brushes using the Brush
    Editor, or by saving images in a special brush file format.

    The Brushes dialog is a dockable dialog; see the section on <link

    manipulating it.  It can be activated in several ways:

      In the Tab menu, you can choose between <guimenuitem>View as

      In Grid mode, the brush shapes are laid out in a rectangular
      array, making it easy to see many at once and find the one you
      are looking for.  In List mode, the shapes are lined up in a
      list, with the names beside them.

      At the top of the dialog appears the name of the currently
      selected brush, and its size in pixels.
    </para>

    <para lang='en'>
      In the center appears a grid view of all available brushes, with
      the currently selected one outlined.  If you see a little "+" to
      the right of a brush, it means the brush is actually larger than
      it appears.  If you see a little red triangle, it means the
      brush is an animated brush, also known as an "image hose".
      Clicking on a brush causes it to be selected as GIMP's current
      brush.  Double-clicking activates the Brush Editor.

    <para lang='en'>
      Below the grid appears a scale entry for "Spacing", which is the
      distance between consecutive brush marks when you trace out a
      brushstroke with the pointer.

            This activates the <link linkend='gimp-brush-editor-dialog'>Brush
            Editor</link>.  Pressing the button will open the Editor
            for any brush.  It only works, however, for parametric
            brushes:  for any other type, the Editor will show you the
            brush but not allow you to do anything with it.

            This creates a new parametric brush, initializes it with a 
            small fuzzy round shape, and opens the Brush Editor so
            that you can modify it.  The new brush is automatically
            saved in your personal <filename>brushes</filename> folder.

          <para>
            This button is only enabled if the currently selected
            brush is a parametric brush.  If so, the brush is
            duplicated, and the Brush Editor is opened so that you can
            modify the copy.  The result is automatically
            saved in your personal <filename>brushes</filename> folder.

            This removes all traces of the brush, both from the dialog
            and the folder where its file is stored, if you have
            permission to do so.  It asks for confirmation before
            doing anything.

            If you add brushes to your personal
            <filename>brushes</filename> folder or any other folder in
            your brush search path, by some means
            other than the Brush Editor, this button
            causes the list to be reloaded, so that the new entries
            will be available in the dialog.

      The functions performed by these buttons can also be accessed

    <para lang='en'>
      If you <emphasis>double-click</emphasis> on the name of a brush,
      you will be able to edit it.  Note, however, that you are only
      allowed to change the names of brushes that you have created
      or installed yourself, not the ones that come pre-installed with
      GIMP.  If you try to rename a pre-installed brush, you will be
      able to edit the name, but as soon as you hit return or click
      somewhere else, the name will revert to its original value.  It
      is a general rule that you cannot alter the resources that GIMP
      pre-installs for you: brushes, patterns, gradients, etc; only
      ones that you create yourself.
