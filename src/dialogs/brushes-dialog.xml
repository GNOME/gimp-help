  <para>
    The <quote>Brushes</quote> dialog is used to select a brush, for use with
    painting tools:
    see the <link linkend="gimp-concepts-brushes">Brushes</link>
    section for basic information on brushes and how they are used in GIMP.
    The dialog also gives you access to several functions for manipulating
    brushes. You can select a brush by clicking on it in the list: it will
    then be shown in the Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the Toolbox. GIMP
    comes now with 56 brushes, different from each other, because the
    size, the ratio and the angle of every brush can be set in the tool
    options dialog. You can also create custom brushes using the Brush Editor,
    or by saving images in a special brush file format.

            is normally horizontal, and the horizontal direction,
            counter-clock-wise. When this value increases, the brush width
            turns counter-clock-wise (0Â° to 180Â°).

            When the brush draws a line, it actually stamps the brush icon
            repeatedly. If brush stamps are very close, you get the impression
            of a solid line: you get that with Spacing = 1. (1.00 to 200.0).

      When you use the Copy or Cut command on an image or a selection of it,
      a copy appears as a new brush in the upper left corner of the
      <quote>Brushes</quote> dialog. This brush will persist until you use
      the Copy command again. It disappears when you close GIMP.
