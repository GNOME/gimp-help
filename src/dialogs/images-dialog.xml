  <para>
    The <quote>Images</quote> Dialog displays the list of open images on your
    screen; each of them is represented with a thumbnail. This dialog is
    useful when you have many overlapping images on your screen: thus, you
    can raise the wanted image to foreground.

  <sect3>
    <title>Activating the dialog</title>
    <para>
      The <quote>Images</quote> dialog is a dockable dialog; see the section
      <xref linkend="gimp-concepts-docks"/> for help on manipulating it.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can access it:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          from the image menu:
          <menuchoice>

            <guisubmenu>Dockable Dialogs</guisubmenu>

          from the Tab menu in any dockable dialog by clicking on

            <inlinegraphic fileref="images/dialogs/stock-menu-left-12.png"/>
          </guiicon> and selecting
          <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Add Tab</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Images</guimenuitem>

    <para>
      In the <guimenu>Windows</guimenu> menu, there is a list of
      <link linkend="gimp-dockable-menu">detached windows</link> which exists
      only if at least one dialog remains open. In this case, you can raise
      the <quote>Images</quote> dialog from the image-menu:
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Images</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.

    <title>Using the Images dialog</title>
    <para>
      In multi-window mode, at the top of the dialog, a drop-list of open images
      appears if the <quote>Show Image Selection</quote> option is checked
      in the Tab Menu.
    </para>
    <para>
      At center, open images appear, as a list or a grid, according to the
      selected mode. The current image is highlighted in list mode, outlined
      in grid mode. With a double click on an image name,  you raise this
      image to the foreground of your screen. With a simple click you select
      this image so that the buttons of the dialog can act on it.
    </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            In the Tab menu for the <quote>Images</quote> dialog, you can choose
            between  <guimenuitem>View as Grid</guimenuitem> and
            <guimenuitem>View as List</guimenuitem>.
            In Grid mode, the images are laid out in a rectangular array.
            In List mode, they are lined up vertically, with each row showing
            a thumbnail of the contents of the image, its name, and its pixel
            dimensions.

            You can change the size of the image previews in the dialog using
            the <quote>Preview Size</quote> submenu of the dialog's Tab menu.

            Three buttons at the bottom of the dialog allow you to operate on
            the selected image. These buttons are present if the <quote>Show
            button bar</quote> is checked in the tab dialog. You can get the
            same commands through the pop menu by right-clicking on the dialog.

          <para>
            The selected image appears at the foreground of your screen. If
            this image has another view, this view also is raised but
            remains behind the original. The same option in the pop-up menu,
            that you get by right-clicking, is called <quote>Raise views
            </quote>

            This command works only on a image which is loaded without any
            window.  Though images can be opened by the New Window command,
            if the image has been already loaded without window by a
            primitive procedure command (such as
            <function>gimp-image-new</function>,
            <function>file-png-load</function>, etc.), it can not be
            unloaded even if its windows are closed to the last.  Then use
            this command to close it.
