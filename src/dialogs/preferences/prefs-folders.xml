    This page allows you to set the locations for two important
    folders used by GIMP for temporary files.  The pages below it
    allow you to customize the locations searched for resources such
    as brushes etc.; see <link linkend='gimp-prefs-folders-data'>Data
    Folders</link> for a description that applies to them.  You 
    can change the folders here by editing the entries, or by pressing
    the buttons on the right to bring up a file chooser window.

        <para>
          This folder is used for temporary files:  files created for
          temporary storage of working data, and then deleted within
          the same GIMP session.  It does not require a lot of space
          or high performance.  By default, a subdirectory called
          <filename>tmp</filename> in your personal GIMP directory is
          used, but if that disk is very cramped for space, or has
          serious performance issues, you can change it to a different
          directory.  The directory must exist and be writable by
          you, or bad things will happen.

      <term lang='en'>Swap folder</term>
      <listitem lang='en'>
        <para>
          This is the folder used as a "memory bank" when the total
          size of images and data open in GIMP exceeds the available
          RAM.  If you work with very large images, or images with
          many layers, or have many images open at once, GIMP can
          potentially require hundreds of megabytes of swap space, so
          available disk space and performance are definitely things
          to think about for this folder.  By default, it is set to
          your personal GIMP directory, but if you have another disk
          with more free space, or substantially better performance,
          you may see a significant benefit from moving your swap
          folder there.  The directory must exist and be writable by
          you.
