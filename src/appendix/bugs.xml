  <para>
    If you find a bug or miss a feature in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, the
    developers would like to know about it so they can look into it.
  </para>

  <para>
    Please follow the instructions on <ulink url="https://www.gimp.org/bugs/"/>.
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para>
      The procedure for making an <emphasis>enhancement
      request</emphasis>&mdash;that is, for asking the developers to add a
      missing feature&mdash;is the same as the procedure for reporting
      a bug.
    </para>
  </tip>

    <para>
      Please also make sure that you are using the 
      <ulink url="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">latest stable version</ulink>
      of <acronym>GIMP</acronym>: reporting bugs that have already been
      fixed is just a waste of everybody's time.
    </para>
