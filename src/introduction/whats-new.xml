    We realize that it would be nice to have localized changes of the
    latest release that links to relevant pages in our documentation.
    However, our team just doesn't have enough volunteers to make that
    happen. We would welcome more people helping out with updating or
    translating our documentation, so don't hesitate to
    <ulink url="https://docs.gimp.org/help.html">contact us</ulink>.
