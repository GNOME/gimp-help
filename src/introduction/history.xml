    The Gimp arose from the ashes of a hideously crafted cs164
    (compilers) class project. The setting: early morning. We were
    both weary from lack of sleep and the terrible strain of
    programming a compiler in LISP. The limits of our patience had
    long been exceeded, and yet still the dam held.

    Gimp 诞生于可怕的需要很多工作量的 cs164 (编译器)课的一个项目，那是一个清晨，我们在缺乏睡眠和用 LISP 编一个编译器的极大压力下显得非常疲劳，那早已经超过了我们耐心的极限，但是我们又不得不忍耐。

    And then it happened. Common LISP messily dumped core when it
    could not allocate the 17 MB it needed to generate a parser for a
    simple grammar using yacc. An unbelieving moment passed, there was
    one shared look of disgust, and then our project was vapor. We had
    to write something...ANYTHING...useful. Something in C. Something
    that did not rely on nested lists to represent a bitmap. Thus, the
    Gimp was born. 
  </para>
  <para lang="zh_CN">
    接着就发生了。当 LISP 无法为 yacc 一个简单语法所需生成的一个解释器分配 17 MB时，出现了常见的糟糕的 core dump。一个让人不敢相信的时刻到来了，大家都感到厌恶，接着我们把项目停止了。我们得写些什么...任何有用的，要是用 C 语言的，要是些不靠嵌套列表(Nested Lists)来表现位图的东西。这样，Gimp 诞生了。

    Like the phoenix, glorious, new life sprung out of the burnt

    An image manipulation program was the consensus. A program that
    would at the very least lessen the necessity of using commercial
    software under `Windoze' or on the `Macintoy.' A program that
    would provide the features missing from the other X painting and
    imaging tools. A program that would help maintain the long
    tradition of excellent and free UNIX applications.

    Six months later, we've reached an early beta stage. We want to

    developing plug-ins and various file format support.

    Version 0.54 was a beta release, but it was so stable that you
    could use it for daily work. However, one of the major drawbacks
    of 0.54 was that the toolkit (the slidebars, menus, dialog boxes,
    etc.)  was built on Motif, a commercial toolkit. This was a big
    drawback for systems like Linux, because you had to buy Motif if
    you wanted to use the faster, dynamically linked Gimp. Many
    developers were also students running Linux, who could not afford
    to buy Motif.

    0.54 版本是一个 beta 版本，不过它已经足够稳定，您能在日常工作中使用它。尽管如此，0.54 版本其中一个最大的缺点就是其工具包(滑条，对话框等。)是基于一个商业工具包 -- Motif 的。这对象 Linux 一样的系统是个大问题，因为如果您想用更快的动态链接的 Gimp，您就不得不买 Motif，而您可能买不起。

    When 0.60 was released in July 1996, it had been under S and P
    (Spencer  and  Peter) development for four months. Main programming
    advantages were the new toolkits, GTK (Gimp Toolkit) and gdk (Gimp
    Drawing Kit), which eliminated the reliance on Motif. For the
    graphic artist, 0.60 was full of new features like: basic layers;
    improved painting tools (sub-pixel sampling, brush spacing); a
    better airbrush; paint modes; etc.

    当0.60 版本在 1996 年七月发行时，它已经在 S 和 P (Spencer 和 Peter)手下开发了四个月。最主要进步是其工具包，GTK (Gimp Toolkit)和 gdk (Gimp Drawing Kit)，它们解决了对 Motif 的依靠。而对图像艺术家而言，0.60 版本包括完整的特性如：基本的图层；加强的涂画工具(半像素采样，画笔空间)；一个更好的喷笔；涂画模式等。

    Version 0.60 was only a developer's release, and was not intended
    for widespread use. It served as a workbench for 0.99 and the
    final 1.0 version, so functions and enhancement could be tested
    and dropped or changed. You can look at 0.60 as the alpha version
    of 0.99.

  <para lang="en">
    In February 1997, 0.99 came on the scene. Together with other
    developers, S and P had made several changes to Gimp and added even
    more features. The main difference was the new API and the PDB,
    which made it possible to write scripts; Script-Fus (or macros)
    could now automate things that you would normally do by
    hand. GTK/gdk had also changed and was now called GTK+. In
    addition, 0.99 used a new form of tile-based memory handling that
    made it possible to load huge images into Gimp (loading a 100 MB
    image into Gimp is no problem). Version 0.99 also introduced a new
    native Gimp file format called XCF.

    The new API made it really easy to write extensions and plug-ins

    the orchestration of Federico Mena to make Gimp ready for
