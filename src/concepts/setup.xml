  <para>
    When first run, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> performs a series of steps to
    configure
    options and directories. The configuration process creates a
    subdirectory in your home directory called
    <filename class="directory">.gimp-2.6</filename>. All of the
    configuration information is stored in this directory. If you remove
    or rename the directory, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will repeat the initial
    configuration process, creating a new
    <filename class="directory">.gimp-2.6</filename>
    directory. Use this capability to explore different configuration
    options without destroying your existing installation, or to recover if
    your configuration files are damaged.

    <para>
      Just a couple of suggestions before you start, though:
      First, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> provides tips you can read at any time
      using the menu command
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Tip of the Day</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
      The tips provide information that is considered useful, but not easy to
      learn by experimenting; so they are worth reading. Please read the tips
      when you have the time.
      Second, if at some point you are trying to do something, and
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      seems to have suddenly stopped functioning, the section
      <link linkend="gimp-using-getting-unstuck">Getting Unstuck</link>
      may help you out. Happy Gimping!
