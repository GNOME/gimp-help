    When first run, GIMP performs a series of steps to configure
    options and directories. The configuration process creates a
    subdirectory in your home directory called
    <filename class="directory">.gimp-2.6</filename>. All of the
    configuration, information is stored in this directory. If you remove
    or rename the directory, GIMP will repeat the initial configuration
    process, creating a new
    <filename class="directory">.gimp-2.6</filename>
    directory. Use this capability to explore different configuration
    options without destroying your existing installation, or to recover if
    your configuration files are damaged.

      Just a couple of suggestions before you start, though: First, GIMP
      displays a "tip" each time it starts. The tips provide information
      that is considered useful, but not easy to learn by experimenting;
      so they are worth reading. If you do not want tips to be displayed
      when GIMP starts, you can disable them;
      but please read the tips when you have the chance: for your
      convenience, you can read them at any time using the menu command
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Tips</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
      Second, if at some point you are trying to do something, and GIMP
      seems to have suddenly stopped functioning, the section
      <link linkend="gimp-using-getting-unstuck">Getting Unstuck</link>
      may help you out. Happy Gimping!
