  <para>
    When first run, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> performs a series of steps to
    configure options and directories. The configuration process creates a
    user-writable configuration directory named
    <filename class="directory">GIMP</filename>, with a per-version subdirectory,
    i.e. <filename class="directory">GIMP/&gimp.app.version;</filename>. All of the
    configuration information is stored in this directory. If you remove
    or rename the directory, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> repeats the initial
    configuration process, creating a new
    <filename class="directory">GIMP/&gimp.app.version;</filename>
    directory. Use this capability to explore different configuration
    options without deleting your existing installation, or to recover if
    your configuration files are damaged.
  </para>

  <para>
    The configuration folder will be stored in:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> (defaulting to <code>$HOME/.config</code>)
          on UNIX platforms, except macOS;
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <code>%APPDATA%</code> on Windows;
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <code>NSApplicationSupportDirectory</code> (usually <code>~/Library/Application Support</code>) on macOS.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Tips and Tricks</title>
    <para>
      Just a couple of suggestions before you start, though:
      First, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> provides tips you can read at any time
      using the menu command
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Tip of the Day</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
      The tips provide information that is considered useful, but not easy to
      learn by experimenting; so they are worth reading. Please read the tips
      when you have the time.
      Second, if at some point you are trying to do something, and
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      seems to have suddenly stopped functioning, the section
      <link linkend="gimp-using-getting-unstuck">Getting Unstuck</link>
      may help you out. Happy Gimping!
