    <para>
      GIMP offers a lot of flexibility about the arrangement
      of dialog windows on your screen. Instead of placing each dialog in its
      own window, you can group them together using docks. A "dock" is a
      container window that can hold a collection of persistent dialogs, such
      as the Tool Options dialog, Brushes dialog, Palette dialog, etc. Docks
      cannot, however, hold image windows: each image always has its own
      separate window. They also can't hold non-persistent dialogs, such as
      the Preferences dialog or the New Image dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is now supplied with two docks:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The Layers, Channels and Paths dock
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The Brushes, Patterns and Gradients dock
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      In these docks, every window is in its own tab.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Toolbox is now also a <emphasis>utility window</emphasis>. The
      Tool Options window is normally attached under the Toolbox and displays
      the options of the selected tool.
    </para>
    <para>
      A list of dockable windows is available in
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Dockable Windows</guisubmenu>
      </menuchoice>.
      Click on the name of one of them to open it as an independent window.
    </para>
    <para>
      Every dockable window has two types of docking areas: the docking bars
      and the docking-tab area.
      In an isolated window, the <emphasis>docking-tab area</emphasis> is
      the same as the drag handle area (see below). In a dock, the
      docking-tab area covers all the window.

      You can drag more than one dialog onto the same docking bar. If you do,

      Some docks contain an <emphasis>Image Menu</emphasis>:
      a menu listing all of the images open in GIMP, and displaying the name

      Image Menu to select a different image (don't confuse this menu for the
      Image Menu that is the Menu of the active image on your screen). If the
      <guilabel>Auto</guilabel> button is depressed, then the menu always
      shows the name of GIMP's currently active image, that is, the image
      you are currently working on.

            dialog's context menu, which contains operations specific to that
            particular type of dialog. For example, the context menu for the
            Patterns dialog contains a set of operations for manipulating
            patterns.

            items in the dialog (cf.
            <xref linkend="figure-gimp-dock-preview-size"/>
            ). For example, the Brushes dialog shows pictures of all available

            These entries are shown in dialogs that allows you to select an
            item from a set: brushes, patterns, fonts, etc. You can choose
            whether to view the items as a vertical list, with the name of
            each beside it, or as a grid, with representations of the items
            but no names. Each has its advantages: viewing as a list gives you
            more information, but viewing as a grid allows you to see many
            more possibilities at once. The default for this varies across
            dialogs: for brushes and patterns, the default is a grid; for most
            other things, the default is a list.

              it depends on your GTK+ keybindings), opens a text box, a
              search field, where you can enter the first letter(s) of the
              name of the item you want.

            This is a toggle. If it is checked, then an Image Menu is shown at
            the top of the dock. It is not available for dialogs docked below
            the Toolbox. Don't confuse this menu with the Image Menu, that is
            the menu of the active image on your screen.

            If this option is checked, the related dialog will be that of the
            current image and will change if you select another image. For
            example, if you have two images and the Histogram dialog on your
            screen (and this option checked in this dialog), then the
            histogram of the activated image will be displayed.
