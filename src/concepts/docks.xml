      GIMP offers a lot of flexibility about the arrangement
      of dialog windows on your screen. Instead of placing each dialog in its
      own window, you can group them together using docks. A "dock" is a
      container window that can hold a collection of persistent dialogs, such
      as the Tool Options dialog, Brushes dialog, Palette dialog, etc. Docks
      cannot, however, hold image windows: each image always has its own
      separate window. They also can't hold non-persistent dialogs, such as
      the Preferences dialog or the New Image dialog.

      Each dock has a set of <emphasis>docking bars</emphasis>,

      unobtrusive and easy not to notice: most people don't realize that they
      exist until they are specifically pointed out.

    <para>
      Each dockable dialog has a <emphasis>drag handle area</emphasis>,
      as highlighted in the figure on the right. You can recognize this by
      the fact that the cursor changes to a hand shape when the pointer is
      over the drag handle area. To dock a dialog, you simply click on its
      drag handle area, and drag it onto one of the docking bars in a dock:
      the dialog will be added to the aimed window. If you drag it onto the
      aimed window itself, then it will be added as a tab.

      You can drag more than one dialog onto the same docking bar. If you do,

      can interact with it.

      Some docks contain an <emphasis>Image Menu</emphasis>:
      a menu listing all of the images open in GIMP, and displaying the name

      Image Menu to select a different image (don't confuse this menu for the
      Image Menu that is the Menu of the active image on your screen). If the
      <guilabel>Auto</guilabel> button is depressed, then the menu always
      shows the name of GIMP's currently active image, that is, the image
      you are currently working on.

            particular type of dialog. For example, the context menu for the
            Patterns dialog contains a set of operations for manipulating
            patterns.

            ). For example, the Brushes dialog shows pictures of all available

            These entries are shown in dialogs that allows you to select an
            item from a set: brushes, patterns, fonts, etc. You can choose
            whether to view the items as a vertical list, with the name of
            each beside it, or as a grid, with representations of the items
            but no names. Each has its advantages: viewing as a list gives you
            more information, but viewing as a grid allows you to see many
            more possibilities at once. The default for this varies across
            dialogs: for brushes and patterns, the default is a grid; for most
            other things, the default is a list.
