    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      A layer effect is a filter that you can tweak at any time,
      that doesn't immediately and more-or-less permanently affect a layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage is that after many more intervening operations,
      you can still go back and tweak the layer effect.
      Unlike Undo, where you might need to Undo and Redo many operations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Also, after saving and reopening an image, you can still tweak its
      layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      You add a layer effect just like other filters, by selecting a layer and
      then choosing a command (a menu item or keyboard shortcut.)
    </para>
    <para>
      A layer effect is a class of filters. You may not know a menu item
      creates a layer effect until you choose the menu item and see the
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon> icon in the Layers dialog.
      Also, when you are adding a filter to an image that will create a
      layer effect (versus creating a destructive effect), the Filter dialog
      will have a Merge Filter button. See
      <link linkend="gimp-filters-common">Common Filter Features</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most Gegl filters can be layer effects.
      No non-Gegl filters can be layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects only apply to a single layer, while other filters may
      apply to channels, layers, or entire images.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can't choose whether a filter <emphasis>can be</emphasis> a
      layer effect. But you can choose to use a filter that <emphasis>can
      be</emphasis> a layer effect in a non-tweakable way:
      see <link linkend="gimp-merging-layer-effects">Merging</link>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Terminology</title>
    <para>
      Gimp represents layer effects with an icon:
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon>.
      The icon appears in the Layer dialog, in the row of the layer the
      layer effect applies to, when you add a layer effect to the layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      The term <emphasis>fx</emphasis> is an abbreviation for <emphasis>effect.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects are also known as "non-destructive edits (NDE)."
      They don't permanently change their layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      This means they have parameters which you can change at a later time.
      Changes to parameters immediately cascade into their layer
      and the entire image.
    </para>
    <para>
      While all filters have an effect on layers, in the sense of a result,
      here we intend the words "layer effect" to mean a certain use of
      certain eligible filters.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Adding a Layer Effect to a Layer</title>
    <para>
      You create a layer effect by selecting a layer,
      then choosing a command
      that is backed by a filter that can be a layer effect.
      Then the
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon>
      icon appears next to the layer name in the
      <link linkend="gimp-layer-dialog">Layers dialog.</link>
    </para>
    <para>
      A layer effect belongs to a layer.
      A layer may have many layer effects, in a stack.
      When you add a layer effect, it adds to the top of any stack of existing
      layer effects. You can later move it, using the
      <link linkend="gimp-layer-effects-dialog">Layer Effects dialog</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Creating a layer effect is undoable.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Order Matters</title>
    <para>
      The order of layer effects matters. Layer effects are stacked above their
      layer. The result of a layer effect propagates down to the layer effect
      underneath it, ultimately to the layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can rearrange the order of layer effects on a layer by choosing a
      layer effect and then clicking the Up Arrow or Down Arrow buttons
      in the <link linkend="gimp-using-layer-effects-dialog">Layer Effects
      dialog.</link>
    </para>
    <para>
      Some changes in order might appear invisible, it depends on the actual
      layer effects and their parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
      Reordering layer effects is undoable.
    </para>
  </sect2>

        The dialog for the filter will appear.
        Change its parameters.

        You can undo Merging Down.

        But it will not undo the changes to the image!

        Just click outside the dialog.

        There is no Cancel button to cancel any changes you have made,

  <sect2 id="gimp-merging-layer-effects">
    <title>Merging</title>
    <para>
      When you choose a menu item that <emphasis>can be</emphasis> a layer effect,
      you can choose to use the filter in a non-tweakable way.
      This is called "Merging", similar to the way you merge layers.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use a filter in a non-tweakable way,
      when you see the filter's dialog,
      choose the "Merge Filter" checkbox.
      Then, after choosing "OK",
      the filter has a non-tweakable result on the layer,
      and no new layer effect is pushed atop the stack of layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can still Undo what you did, or do it again with different choices.
      But it won't appear in the stack of layer effects.
      And if you subsequently do other operations,
      it will be harder to undo than if you use the filter as a layer effect.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Merging and Auxiliary Other Images</title>
    <para>
      Some filters take two images, the active image and another "auxiliary" image,
      which you must separately choose in the filter's dialog.
      The auxiliary image may be called for example a "bump map" or a "mask."
    </para>
    <para>
      Such a filter's dialog will have "Merge Filter" checkbox checked and disabled.
      This means that the filter won't become a layer effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      We anticipate that in the future, filters that take auxiliary other images
      might be tweakable and appear as layer effects.

  <sect2>
    <title>Undo and Layer Effects</title>
    <para>
      You can undo adding or removing a layer effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      You cannot use the Undo menu item to revert changing the parameters of a layer effect.
      Instead, just keep changing the parameters from your own memory.
      To record a set of parameter values, you can save them as a preset,
      the same as for other filters.

    <title>Persistence of Layer Effects</title>
    <para>
      Layer effects are saved when you save an image in the XCF format.
      All the presets for a layer effect are also saved.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects are <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> saved, but "merged",
      when you export an image to another format.
      You don't have a choice in the matter when exporting.

      For now, layer effects are not saved even in formats
      which also support layer effects, such as the PSD format.

      A preset is a template.
      You apply a preset to an application, or instance, of the filter.
