    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      A layer effect is a filter that can much later be tweaked,
      that doesn't immediately and more-or-less permanently affect a layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage is that after many more intervening operations,
      you can still go back and tweak the layer effect.
      Unlike Undo, where you might need to Undo and Redo many operations.
    </para>
    <para>
      You add a layer effect just like other filters,
      by selecting a layer and then
      choosing a menu item.
    </para>
    <para>
      A layer effect is a class of filters.
      You may not know a menu item creates a layer effect until you choose the menu item
      and see the
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon> icon.
    </para>
    <para>
      All Gegl filters can be layer effects.
      No non-Gegl filters can be layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects always apply to layers,
      while other filters may apply to channels, layers, or entire images.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can't choose whether a filter <emphasis>can be</emphasis> a layer effect.
      But you can choose to use a filter that <emphasis>can be</emphasis> a layer effect
      in a non-tweakable way: see "Merging."
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Terminology</title>
    <para>
      A layer effect is also known as an <emphasis>fx</emphasis>.
      "fx" is the slang term for "effects."
      Gimp represents layer effects with an icon:
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects are also known as "non-destructive edits (NDE)."
      They don't permanently change their layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects may also be called "parametric."
      This means they have parameters which you can much later tweak.
      Changes to parameters immediately cascade into their layer
      and the entire image.
      Compare with "parametric design" in CAD (Computer Aided Design.)
    </para>
    <para>
      While all filters have an effect on layers, in the sense of a result,
      here we intend the words "layer effect" to mean a certain use of
      certain eligible filters.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Association with Layers</title>
    <para>
      A layer effect belongs to a layer.
      A layer may have many layer effects, in a stack.
    </para>
    <para>
      You create a layer effect by selecting a layer,
      then choosing a menu item
      that is backed by filter that can be a layer effect.
      Then the
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/stock-icons/gimp-effects.svg" contentwidth="16px"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon>
      icon appear next to the layer name in the Layers dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      Creating a layer effect is undoable.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Order Matters</title>
    <para>
      The order of layer effects matters.
      Layer effects are stacked above their layer.
      The result of a layer effect propagates down to the layer effect underneath it,
      ultimately to the layer.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can rearrange the order of layer effects on a layer
      by choosing a layer effect
      and then clicking the Up Arrow or Down Arrow buttons
      in the Layer Effects dialog.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some changes in order might not seem to have any visible effect,
      it depends on the actual layer effects and their parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
      Reordering layer effects is undoable.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Merging</title>
    <para>
      When you choose a menu item that <emphasis>can be</emphasis> a layer effect,
      you can choose to use the filter in a non-tweakable way.
      This is called "Merging", similar to the way you merge layers.
    </para>
    <para>
      To use a filter in a non-tweakable way,
      when you see the filter's dialog,
      choose the "Merge Filter" checkbox.
      Then, after choosing "OK",
      the filter has a non-tweakable result on the layer,
      and no new layer effect is pushed atop the stack of layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can still Undo what you did, or do it again with different choices.
      But it won't appear in the stack of layer effects.
      And if you subsequently do other operations,
      it will be harder to undo than if you use the filter as a layer effect.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Merging and Auxiliary Other Images</title>
    <para>
      Some filters take two images, the active image and another "auxiliary" image,
      which you must separately choose in the filter's dialog.
      The auxiliary image may be called for example a "bump map" or a "mask."
    </para>
    <para>
      Such a filter's dialog will have "Merge Filter" checkbox checked and disabled.
      This means that the filter won't appear as a layer effect in the stack of layer effects.
    </para>
    <para>
      We anticipate that in the future, filters that take auxiliary other images might be tweakable and appear as layer effects.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Undo and Layer Effects</title>
    <para>
      You can undo adding or removing a layer effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      You cannot use the Undo menu item to revert tweaking the parameters of a layer effect.
      Instead, just keep tweaking the parameters from your own memory.
      To record a set of parameter values, you can save them as a preset of the layer effect.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Persistence of Layer Effects</title>
    <para>
      Layer effects are saved when you save an image in the XCF format.
      All the presets for a layer effect are also saved.
    </para>
    <para>
      Layer effects are *NOT* saved, but "merged",
      when you export an image to another format.
      You don't have a choice in the matter when exporting.
    </para>
    <para>
      For now, layer effects are not saved even in formats
      which also support layer effects, such as the PSD format.
    </para>
  </sect2>
