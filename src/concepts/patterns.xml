  <para>
    A <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> is an image, usually small, used
    for filling regions by <emphasis>tiling</emphasis>, that is, by
    placing copies of the pattern side by side like ceramic tiles.  A
    pattern is said to be <emphasis>tileable</emphasis> if copies of
    it can be adjoined left-edge-to-right-edge and
    top-edge-to-bottom-edge without creating obvious seams.  Not all
    useful patterns are tileable, but tileable patterns are nicest for
    many purposes.  (A <emphasis>texture</emphasis>, by the way, is
    the same thing as a pattern.)

        When you <emphasis>stroke</emphasis> a path or selection, you

        selection using a painting tool.

  <tip>
    <para>
      Note: Patterns do not need to be opaque. If you fill or paint using a
      pattern with translucent or transparent areas, then the previous
      contents of the area will show through from behind it. This is one of
      many ways of doing <quote>overlays</quote> in GIMP.
    </para>
  </tip>
  <para>
    When you install GIMP, it comes presupplied with a few dozen
    patterns, which seem to have been chosen more or less randomly.
    You can also add new patterns, either ones you create yourself, or
    ones you download from the vast number available online.
  </para>
  <para>
    GIMP's <emphasis>current pattern</emphasis>,
    used in most pattern-related operations, is shown in the
    Brush/Pattern/Gradient area of the Toolbox. Clicking on the pattern symbol
    brings up the <link linkend="gimp-pattern-dialog">Patterns dialog</link>,
    which allows you to select a different pattern. You can also access the
    Patterns dialog by menu, or dock it so that it is present continuously.
  </para>
  <para>
    To add a new pattern to the collection, so that it shows up in the
    Patterns dialog, you need to save it in a format GIMP can use, in a folder
    included in GIMP's pattern search path. There are several file formats you
    can use for patterns:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>PAT</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <filename class="extension">.pat</filename> format is used for
          patterns which were created specifically for GIMP. You can convert
          any image into a <filename class="extension">.pat</filename> file by
          opening it in GIMP and then saving it using a file name ending in
          <filename class="extension">.pat</filename>.
        </para>
        <caution>
          <!-- see bug #573828 -->
          <para>
            Do not confuse <acronym>GIMP</acronym>-generated
            <filename class="extension">.pat</filename> files with files
            created by other programs (e.g.
            <application>Photoshop</application>) &ndash; after all,
            <filename class="extension">.pat</filename> is just a part of an
            (arbitrary) file name.
          </para>
          <para>
            (However, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> <emphasis>does</emphasis>
            support <application>Photoshop</application>
            <filename class="extension">.pat</filename> files until a certain
            version.)
          </para>

        <para>
          Since GIMP 2.2 you can use
          <filename class="extension">.png</filename>,
          <filename class="extension">.jpg</filename>,
          <filename class="extension">.bmp</filename>,
          <filename class="extension">.gif</filename>, or
          <filename class="extension">.tiff</filename> files as patterns.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
    To make a pattern available, you place it in one of the folders in GIMP's
    pattern search path. By default, the pattern search path includes two
    folders, the system <filename>patterns</filename> folder, which you should
    not use or alter, and the <filename>patterns</filename>
    folder inside your personal GIMP directory. You can add new folders to the
    pattern search path using the
    <link linkend="gimp-prefs-folders-data">Pattern Folders</link>
    page of the Preferences dialog. Any PAT file (or, in GIMP 2.2, any of the
    other acceptable formats) included in a folder in the pattern search path
    will show up in the Patterns dialog the next time you start GIMP.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are countless ways of creating interesting patterns in GIMP, using
    the wide variety of available tools and filters -- particularly the
    rendering filters. You can find tutorials for this in many locations,
    including the GIMP home page <xref linkend="bibliography-online-gimp"/>.
    Some of the filters have options that allows you to make their results
    tileable. Also, see <xref linkend="script-fu-tile-blur"/>, this
    filter allows you to blend the edges of an image in order to make it more
    smoothly tileable.

    Also of interest are a set of pattern-generating scripts that come with
    GIMP: you can find them in the menu bar, through
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Create</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Patterns</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>.
    Each of the scripts creates a new image filled with a particular type of
    pattern: a dialog pops up that allows you to set parameters controlling
    the details of the appearance. Some of these patterns are most useful for
    cutting and pasting; others serve best as
