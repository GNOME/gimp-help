    Paint tools, which are normally in Toolbox, have a preset system that have
    been much improved with <acronym>GIMP</acronym>-2.8. Color tools (except
    Posterize and Desaturate), which are not normally in Toolbox, have there 
    own preset system. But, if you add these color tools to Toolbox through 
    Preferences, you can also create presets for them, according to the same 
    preset system as for paint tools.
