  <para>
    If you often use tools with particular settings, presets are for you. You
    can save these settings and get them back when you want.
  </para>

  <para>
    Paint tools, which are normally in Toolbox, have a preset system that have
    been much improved with <acronym>GIMP</acronym>-2.8. Color tools (except
    Posterize and Desaturate), which are not normally in Toolbox, have their
    own preset system.
  </para>

  <para>
    Four buttons at the bottom of all tools options dialogs allow you to save,
    restore, delete or reset presets.
