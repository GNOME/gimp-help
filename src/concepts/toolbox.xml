    The Main Toolbox is the heart of GIMP. It is the only part of the
    application that you cannot duplicate or close. Here is a quick tour of
    what you will find there.
  </para>
  <tip>
    <para>
      In the Toolbox, as in most parts of GIMP, moving the mouse on top
      of something and letting it rest for a moment will usually bring
      up a "tooltip" message that may help you understand what the thing
      is or what you can do with it.  Also, in many cases you can press
      the <keycap>F1</keycap> key to get help about the thing that is
      underneath the mouse.
    </para>
  </tip>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Tool icons:</emphasis> These icons are buttons which
        activate tools for a wide variety of purposes: selecting parts of
        images, painting on them, transforming them, etc.  The <link linkend="gimp-toolbox-introduction">Toolbox Introduction</link>
        section gives an overview of how to work with tools, and each tool is
        described systematically in the <link linkend="gimp-toolbox">Tools</link> chapter.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Foreground/Background colors:</emphasis>
        The color areas here show you GIMP's current foreground and background
        colors, which come into play in many operations. Clicking on either
        one of them brings up a color selector dialog that allows you to
        change to a different color. Clicking on the double-headed arrow swaps
        the two colors, and clicking on the small symbol in the lower left
        corner resets them to black and white.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Brush/Pattern/Gradient:</emphasis>
        The symbols here show you <acronym>GIMP's</acronym>
        current selections for: the Paintbrush, used by all tools that allow
        you to paint on the image (<quote>painting</quote> includes
        operations like erasing and smudging, by the way); for the Pattern,
        which is used in filling selected areas of an image; and for the
        Gradient, which comes into play whenever an operation requires a
        smoothly varying range of colors. Clicking on any of these symbols
        brings up a dialog window that allows you to change it.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Active Image:</emphasis> In <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you
        can work with many images at once, but at any given moment, one of
        them is the <quote>active image</quote>. Here you find a small
        iconic representation of the active image. Clicking on it brings up
        a dialog with a list of all the currently open images, allowing you
        to make a different one active if you want to. (Clicking on the
        window where the image is displayed will accomplish the same thing,
        though.)
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          The <quote>Active Image</quote> preview is disabled by default. If
          you want it, you can enable it in the
          <link linkend="gimp-prefs-toolbox">Toolbox Preferences</link> tab.
        </para>
      </note>

    <para>
      At every start, GIMP selects a tool (the brush), a color, a brush and
      a pattern by default, always the same. If you want GIMP to select the
      last tool, color, brush and pattern you used when quitting your
      previous session, check the <guilabel>Save input device settings
        on exit</guilabel> in
      <link linkend="gimp-prefs-input-devices">Preferences/Input
        Devices</link>.
    </para>
  </note>
  <tip>
    <para>
      You can get rid of the "Wilber's eyes" (replacing the old Toolbox
      menu) from the Toolbox by adding the following line to your gimprc
      file: <function>(toolbox-wilber no)</function>.
      It only affects the toolbox. The eyes in the Image window are only
      visible when you do not have an open image.
