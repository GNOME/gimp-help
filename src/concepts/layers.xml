  <title>Introduction to Layers</title>

  <para>
    A good way to visualize a <acronym>GIMP</acronym> image is as a stack of
    transparencies: in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> terminology, each
    individual transparency is called a
    <emphasis>layer</emphasis>. There is no limit, in principle, to the number
    of layers an image can have: only the amount of memory available on the
    system. It is not uncommon for advanced users to work with images
    containing dozens of layers.
  </para>
  <para>
    The organization of layers in an image is shown by the Layers dialog,
    which is the second most important type of dialog window in
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, after
    the Main Toolbox. The appearance of the Layers dialog is shown in the
    adjoining illustration. How it works is described in detail in the
    <link linkend="gimp-layer-dialog">Layers Dialog</link>
    section, but we will touch on some aspects of it here, in relation to the
    layer properties that they display.
  </para>
  <para>
    <indexterm><primary>Drawable</primary></indexterm>
    Each open image has at any time a single
    <emphasis>active drawable</emphasis>. A <quote>drawable</quote>
    is a <acronym>GIMP</acronym> concept that includes layers, but also
    several other types of
    things, such as channels, layer masks, and the selection mask. (Basically,
    a <quote>drawable</quote>
    is anything that can be drawn on with painting tools). If a layer is
    currently active, it is shown highlighted in the Layers dialog, and its
    name is shown in the status area of the image window. If not, you can
    activate it by clicking on it. If none of the layers are highlighted, it
    means the active drawable is something other than a layer.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the menubar above an image window, you can find a menu called
    <guimenu>Layer</guimenu>, containing a number of commands that
    affect the active layer of the image.  The same menu can be
    accessed by right-clicking in the Layers dialog.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="gimp-layer-properties">
    <title>Layer Properties</title>

    <para>
      Each layer in an image has a number of important attributes:

          <para>
            Every layer has a name. This is assigned automatically when the
            layer is created, but you can change it. You can change the name
            of a layer either by double-clicking on it in the Layers dialog,
            or by right-clicking there and then selecting the top entry in the
            menu that appears,
            <guimenuitem>Edit Layer Attributes</guimenuitem>.

          <para>
            An alpha channel encodes information about how transparent a layer
            is at each pixel. It is visible in the Channel Dialog: white is
            complete opacity, black is complete transparency and grey levels
            are partial transparencies.
          </para>
          <para>
            The background layer is particular. If you have just created a
            new image, it has still only one layer which is a background
            layer. If the image has been created with an opaque Fill type,
            this one layer has no Alpha channel. If you add a new layer,
            even with an opaque Fill type, an Alpha channel is automatically
            created, which applies to all layers apart from the background
            layer. To get a background layer with transparency, either you
            create your new image with a transparent Fill type, or you use
            the
            <link linkend="gimp-layer-alpha-add">Add an Alpha Channel</link>.
          </para>
          <para>
            Every layer other than the bottom layer of an image has
            automatically an Alpha channel, but you can't see a grayscale
            representation of the alpha values. See
            <link linkend="glossary-alpha">Alpha</link> in Glossary for
            more information.

                      that an alpha Channel has been added. It is white because
                      the image is not transparent since there is at least one
                      100% opaque layer. The current layer is the red one : since
                      it is painted with pure red, there is no green and no blue
                      and the corresponding channels are black.

            The layer type is determined by the image type (see previous
            section) and the presence or absence of an alpha channel. These
            are the possible layer types:

          <para>
            The main reason this matters is that most filters (in the
            <guimenu>Filters</guimenu>
            menu) only accept a subset of layer types, and appear grayed out
            in the menu if the active layer does not have an acceptable type.
            Often you can rectify this either by changing the mode of the
            image or by adding or removing an alpha channel.

            It is possible to temporarily remove a layer from an image,
            without destroying it, by clicking on the symbol in the Layers
            dialog. This is called <quote>toggling the visibility</quote>
            of the layer. Most operations on an image treat toggled-off layers
            as if they did not exist. When you work with images containing
            many layers, with varying opacity, you often can get a better
            picture of the contents of the layer you want to work on by hiding
            some of the other layers.

          <para>
            In <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, the boundaries of a layer do not
            necessarily match the
            boundaries of the image that contains it. When you create text,
            for example, each text item goes into its own separate layer, and
            the layer is precisely sized to contain the text and nothing more.
            Also, when you create a new layer using cut-and-paste, the new
            layer is sized just large enough to contain the pasted item. In
            the image window, the boundaries of the currently active layer are
            shown outlined with a black-and-yellow dashed line.
          </para>
          <para>
            The main reason why this matters is that you cannot do anything to
            a layer outside of its boundaries: you can't act on what doesn't
            exist. If this causes you problems, you can alter the dimensions
            of the layer using any of several commands that you can find near
            the bottom of the <guimenu>Layer</guimenu> menu.
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              The amount of memory that a layer consumes is determined by its
              dimensions, not its contents. So, if you are working with large
              images or images that contain many layers, it might pay off to
              trim layers to the minimum possible size.

            The opacity of a layer determines the extent to which it lets
            colors from layers beneath it in the stack show through. Opacity
            ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning complete transparency, and
            100 meaning complete opacity.

            The Mode of a layer determines how colors from the layer are
            combined with colors from the underlying layers to produce a
            visible result. This is a sufficiently complex, and sufficiently
            important, concept to deserve a section of its own, which follows.

            In addition to the alpha channel, there is another way to control
            the transparency of a layer: by adding a
            <emphasis>layer mask</emphasis>,
            which is an extra grayscale drawable associated with the layer.
            A layer does not have a layer mask by default: it must be added
            specifically. Layer masks, and how to work with them, are
            described much more extensively in the
            <link linkend="gimp-layer-mask">Layer Mask</link> section.

            In the upper left corner of the Layers dialog appears a small
            checkbox that controls the <quote>Lock</quote>
            setting for the transparency of the layer (see the figure below).
            If this is checked, then the alpha channel for the layer is
            locked, and no manipulation has any effect on it. In particular,
            nothing that you do to a transparent part of the layer will have
            any effect.
