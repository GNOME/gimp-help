    The GIMP user interface is now available in two modes:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          multi-window mode,
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          single window mode.

  </para>
  <para>
    When you open GIMP for the first time, it opens in multi-window mode by
    default. You can enable single-window mode through
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>>Single-Window Mode</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>) in the image menu bar.
    After quitting GIMP with this option enabled, GIMP will start in
    single-window mode next time.

          <para>
            You can notice two panels, left and right, and an image window in
            middle. A second image is partially masked. The left panel collects
            Toolbox and Tool Options dialog together. The right panel collects
            layers, channels, paths, undo history dialogs together in a
            multi-tab dock, brushes, patterns and gradients dialogs
            together in another dock below. You can move these panels on
            screen. You can also mask them using the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key.

              By default, it also contains the foreground and background colors.
              You can add brush, pattern, gradient and active image icons.

            <para>
              <emphasis>Tool options:</emphasis>
              Docked below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing
              options for the currently selected tool (in this case, the
              Move tool).

            <para>
              <emphasis>Image windows:</emphasis>
              Each image open in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is displayed in a
              separate window. Many images can be open at the same time, limited
              by only the system resources. Before you can do anything useful in
              <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you need to have at least	one image
              window open. The image window holds the Menu of the main commands
              of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> (File, Edit, Select...), which you can
              also get by right-clicking on the window.
            </para>
            <para>
              An image can be bigger than the image window. In that case, GIMP
              displays the image in a reduced zoom level which allows to see the
              full image in the image window. If you turn to the 100% zoom
              level, scroll bars appear, allowing you to pan across the image.

              The <emphasis>Layers, Channels, Paths, Undo History</emphasis>
              dock &mdash; note that the dialogs in the dock are tabs.
              The Layers tab is open : it shows the layer structure of
              the currently
              active image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of
              ways. It is possible to do a few very basic things without using
              the Layers dialog, but even moderately sophisticated
              <acronym>GIMP</acronym> users find it indispensable to have the
              Layers dialog available at all times.

              <para>
                Left and right panels are fixed; you can't move them. But you
                can decrease or increase their width. If you reduce the width of
                a multi-tab dock, there may be not enough place for all tabs;
                then arrow-heads appear allowing you to scroll through tabs.

                As in multi-window mode, you can mask these panels using the

              <para>
                When several images are open, a new bar appears above the image
                window, with a tab for every image. You can navigate between
                images by clicking on tabs or either using
                <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>PageUp or
                PageDown</keycap></keycombo> or
<keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Number</keycap></keycombo>.
                <quote>Number</quote> is tab number; you must use the number
                keys of the upper line of your keyboard, not that of keypad
                (Alt-shift necessary for some national keyboards).

    <para>
      This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs
      used by <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for various purposes, but users typically
      open them when they need them and close them when they are done.
      Knowledgeable users generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and
      Layers dialog open at all times. The Toolbox is essential to many
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> operations. The Tool Options section is actually
      a separate dialog, shown docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot.
      Knowledgeable users almost always have it set up this way: it is very
      difficult to use tools effectively without being able to see how their
      options are set. The Layers dialog comes into play when you work with an
      image with multiple layers: after you advance beyond the most basic stages
      of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> expertise, this means
      <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>.
      And of course it helps to display the images you're editing on the screen;
      if you close the image window before saving your work,
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will ask you whether you want to close the file.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        If your <acronym>GIMP</acronym> layout is lost, your arrangement
        is easy to recover using
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
          <guisubmenu>Recently Closed Docks</guisubmenu>
        </menuchoice>
        ; the Windows menu command is only available while an image is open.
        To add, close, or detach a tab from a dock, click
        <guiicon>
          <inlinemediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/using/tab-icon.png"/>
            </imageobject>
          </inlinemediaobject>
        </guiicon>
        in the upper right corner of a dialog. This opens the Tab menu. Select
        <guimenuitem>Add Tab</guimenuitem>,<guimenuitem> Close Tab
        </guimenuitem>, or <guimenuitem>Detach Tab</guimenuitem>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The following sections walk you through the components of each of the
      windows shown in the screenshot, explaining what they are and how they
      work. Once you have read them, plus the section describing the basic
      structure of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> images, you should have learned
      enough to use <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for a
      wide variety of basic image manipulations. You can then look through the
      rest of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the
      almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things that are
      possible. Have fun!
