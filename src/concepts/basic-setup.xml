    <para>
      The screenshot above shows the most basic arrangement of GIMP windows
      that can be used effectively.
    </para>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>The Main Toolbox:</emphasis>
        This is the heart of GIMP. It contains the highest level menu,
        plus a set of icon buttons that can be used to select tools, and more.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Tool options:</emphasis>
        Docked below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing
        options for the currently selected tool (in this case, the Rectangle
        Select tool).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>An image window:</emphasis>
        Each image open in GIMP is displayed in a separate window. Many images
	can be open at the same time, only limited by the system resources.
	Before you can do anything useful in GIMP, you need to have at least
	one image window open.  The image window holds the Menu of the main
	commands of GIMP (File, Edit, Select...), which you can also get by
	right-clicking on the window.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The <emphasis>Layers, Channels, Paths</emphasis> dock with the
        Layers Dialog open.
        This dialog window shows the layer structure of the currently active
        image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. It is
        possible to do a few very basic things without using the Layers
        dialog, but even moderately sophisticated GIMP users find it
        indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all times.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis>Brushes/Patterns/Gradients:</emphasis>
        The docked dialog below the layer dialog shows the dialogs for
        managing brushes, patterns and gradients.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>
    This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs
    used by GIMP for various purposes, but users typically open them when
    they need them and close them when they are done. Knowledgeable users
    generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and Layers dialog around at
    all times. The Toolbox is essential to many GIMP operations; in fact, if
    you close it, GIMP will exit after confirming that that is actually what
    you want to do. The Tool Options section is actually a separate dialog, shown
    docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost
    always have it set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools
    effectively without being able to see how their options are set. The
    Layers dialog comes into play whenever you work with an image that has
    multiple layers: once you advance beyond the very most basic stages of
    GIMP expertise, this means <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>.
    And of course it helps to display the images you're editing on the screen;
    if you close the image window before saving your work, GIMP will ask you
    whether you want to close the file.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      If your GIMP layout gets trashed, fortunately your arrangement
      is pretty easy to recover by using
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Windows</guimenu><guisubmenu>Recently Closed Docks</guisubmenu></menuchoice>
      To add, close or detach a tab from a dock, click on
      <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="../images/using/tab-icon.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>
      in the upper right corner of a dialog. This opens the Tab menu. Select
      <guimenuitem>Add Tab</guimenuitem>,<guimenuitem> Close Tab
      </guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Detach Tab</guimenuitem>.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    Unlike some other programs, GIMP does not give you the option of putting
    all your controls and image displays into a single comprehensive
    window. The GIMP developers have always felt that this is a poor way of
    working, because it forces the program to do the work of a
    dedicated window manager. Not
    only would this waste a lot of programmer time, it is almost impossible to
    do in a way that works correctly across all of the operating systems GIMP
    is intended to run on.
  </para>
  <para>
    Earlier versions of GIMP (up to GIMP 1.2.5) were very profligate with
    dialogs: advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at
    once, scattered all over the screen and very difficult to keep track of.
    GIMP 2.0 is much better in this respect, because it allows dialogs to be
    docked together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot
    actually contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels,
    Paths, and Undo.) The system takes a little while to learn, but once you
    learn it, we hope that you will like it.
  </para>
  <para>
    The following sections will walk you through the components of each of the
    windows shown in the screenshot, explaining what they are and how they
    work. Once you have read them, plus the section describing the basic
    structure of GIMP images, you should have learned enough to use GIMP for a
    wide variety of basic image manipulations. You can then look through the
    rest of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the
    almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things that are
    possible. Have fun!
