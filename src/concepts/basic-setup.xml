  <orderedlist>
    <para>
      The screenshot above shows the most basic arrangement of
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> windows that can be used effectively.
    </para>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>The Main Toolbox:</emphasis>
        Contains a set of icon buttons used to select tools.
        May also contain the foreground and background colors;
        brush, pattern, and Gradient; and an icon of the active image.
        Use 
        <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu>
        <guisubmenu>Toolbox</guisubmenu>
      </menuchoice>
      to enable, or disable the extra items.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Tool options:</emphasis>
        Docked below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing
        options for the currently selected tool (in this case, the Smudge
        tool).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>An image window:</emphasis>
        Each image open in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> is displayed in a separate
        window. Many
        images can be open at the same time, limited by only the system
        resources. Before you can do anything useful in
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, you need to
        have at least	one image window open. The image window holds the
        Menu of the main commands of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> (File, Edit,
        Select...), which you can also get by right-clicking on the window.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The <emphasis>Layers, Channels, Paths</emphasis> dock with the
        Layers Dialog open; note that the <quote>dialogs</quote> in the
        <quote>dock</quote> are tabs.
        This dialog window shows the layer structure of the currently active
        image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. It is
        possible to do a few very basic things without using the Layers
        dialog, but even moderately sophisticated <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
        users find it
        indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all times.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Brushes/Patterns/Gradients:</emphasis>
        The docked dialog below the layer dialog shows the dialogs (tabs) for
        managing brushes, patterns and gradients.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>
    This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs
    used by <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for various purposes, but users typically
    open them when they need them and close them when they are done.
    Knowledgeable users generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and
    Layers dialog open at all times. The Toolbox is essential to many
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> operations; in fact, if
    you close it, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will exit after confirming that that
    is actually what you want to do. The Tool Options section is actually
    a separate dialog, shown
    docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost
    always have it set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools
    effectively without being able to see how their options are set. The
    Layers dialog comes into play when you work with an image with
    multiple layers: after you advance beyond the most basic stages of
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> expertise, this means
    <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>.
    And of course it helps to display the images you're editing on the screen;
    if you close the image window before saving your work,
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will ask you whether you want to close the file.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      If your <acronym>GIMP</acronym> layout is lost, your arrangement
      is easy to recover using
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Windows</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Recently Closed Docks</guisubmenu>
      </menuchoice>
      ; the Windows menu command is only available while an image is open.
      To add, close, or detach a tab from a dock, click
      <guiicon>
        <inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/using/tab-icon.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>
      </guiicon>
      in the upper right corner of a dialog. This opens the Tab menu. Select
      <guimenuitem>Add Tab</guimenuitem>,<guimenuitem> Close Tab
      </guimenuitem>, or <guimenuitem>Detach Tab</guimenuitem>.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> does not support placing all controls and images
    into a single comprehensive window. The consensus in the
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> community, is that
    multiple windows offers a better user experience&mdash;and a
    single window is difficult to do in a way that works correctly
    across all of the operating systems on which
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> runs.
  </para>
  <para>
    Earlier versions of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> (up to
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 1.2.5) used many dialogs:
    advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at
    once, scattered all over the screen and very difficult to track.
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym> 2.0 is much better in this respect, because it
    allows dialogs to be
    docked together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot
    actually contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels,
    Paths, and Undo.) The system takes a little while to learn, but once you
    learn it, we hope that you will like it.
  </para>
  <para>
    The following sections walk you through the components of each of the
    windows shown in the screenshot, explaining what they are and how they
    work. Once you have read them, plus the section describing the basic
    structure of <acronym>GIMP</acronym> images, you should have learned
    enough to use <acronym>GIMP</acronym> for a
    wide variety of basic image manipulations. You can then look through the
    rest of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the
    almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things that are
    possible. Have fun!
