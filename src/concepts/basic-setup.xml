      The screenshot above shows the most basic arrangement of GIMP windows
      that can be used effectively. Three windows are shown:

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>The Main Toolbox:</emphasis>
        This is the heart of GIMP. It contains the highest level menu,
        plus a set of icon buttons that can be used to select tools, and more.
      </para>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Tool options:</emphasis>
        Docked below the main Toolbox is a Tool Options dialog, showing
        options for the currently selected tool (in this case, the Rectangle
        Select tool).
      </para>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>An image window:</emphasis>
        Each image open in GIMP is displayed in a separate window. Many images
        can be open at the same time: the limit is set only by the amount of
        system resources. It is possible to run GIMP without having any images
        open, but there are not very many useful things to do then.
      </para>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Layers Dialog:</emphasis>
        This dialog window shows the layer structure of the currently active
        image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. It is
        possible to do a few very basic things without using the Layers
        dialog, but even moderately sophisticated GIMP users find it
        indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all times.
      </para>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Brushes/Patterns/Gradients:</emphasis>
        The docked dialog below the layer dialog shows the dialogs for
        managing brushes, patterns and gradients.
      </para>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>
    This is a minimal setup. There are over a dozen other types of dialogs
    used by GIMP for various purposes, but users typically create them when
    they are needed and close them when they are not. Knowledgeable users
    generally keep the Toolbox (with Tool Options) and Layers dialog around at
    all times. The Toolbox is essential to many GIMP operations; in fact, if
    you close it, GIMP will exit. (You are asked to confirm that you want to
    do this, though.) The Tool Options are actually a separate dialog, shown
    docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost
    always have them set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools
    effectively without being able to see how their options are set. The
    Layers dialog comes into play whenever you work with an image that has
    multiple layers: once you advance beyond the very most basic stages of
    GIMP expertise, this means <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>.
    And finally, of course, the necessity of having images displayed in
    order to work with them is perhaps obvious.

  <note>
    <para>
      If your GIMP layout gets trashed, fortunately the arrangement
      shown in the screenshot is pretty easy to recover.  In the
      <guimenu moreinfo="none">File</guimenu> menu from the Main Toolbox, selecting
      <menuchoice moreinfo="none">
        <guimenu moreinfo="none">File</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu moreinfo="none">Dialogs</guisubmenu>
        <guisubmenu moreinfo="none">Create New Dock</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Layers, Channels, and Paths</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      will give you a Layers dialog just like the one shown.  In the
      same menu, selecting
      <menuchoice moreinfo="none">
        <guimenu moreinfo="none">File</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu moreinfo="none">Dialogs</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Tool Options</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      gives you a new Tool Options dialog, which you can then dock
      below the Main Toolbox.  (The section on <link linkend="gimp-concepts-docks">Dialogs and Docking</link> explains how to
      dock dialogs.)  There is no need to be able to create a new Main
      Toolbox, because you cannot get rid of the one you have without
      causing GIMP to exit.

  <para>
    Unlike some other programs, GIMP does not give you the option of putting
    everything—controls and image displays—all into a single comprehensive
    window. GIMP developers have always felt that this is a poor way of
    working, because it forces the program to perform a wide range of
    functions that are much better done by a dedicated window manager. Not
    only would this waste a lot of programmer time, it is almost impossible to
    do in a way that works correctly across all of the operating systems GIMP
    is intended to run on.

  <para>
    Earlier versions of GIMP (up to GIMP 1.2.5) were very profligate with
    dialogs: advanced users often had half a dozen or more dialogs open at
    once, scattered all over the screen and very difficult to keep track of.
    GIMP 2.0 is much better in this respect, because it allows dialogs to be
    docked together in a flexible way. (The Layers dialog in the screenshot
    actually contains four dialogs, represented by tabs: Layers, Channels,
    Paths, and Undo.) The system takes a little while to learn, but once you
    learn it, we hope that you will like it.

  <para>
    The following sections will walk you through the components of each of the
    windows shown in the screenshot, explaining what they are and how they
    work. Once you have read them, plus the section describing the basic
    structure of GIMP images, you should have learned enough to use GIMP for a
    wide variety of basic image manipulations. You can then look through the
    rest of the manual at your leisure (or just experiment) to learn the
    almost limitless number of more subtle and specialized things that are
    possible. Have fun!
