    <title>Script-Fu? </title>
    <para>
      Script-Fu is what the Windows world would call "macros" But Script-Fu is
      more powerful than that. Script-Fu is based on an interpreting language
      called Scheme, and works by using querying functions to the
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      database. You can do all kinds of things with Script-Fu, but an ordinary
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> user will probably use it for automating things
      that:

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Remember that you can do a whole lot with Script-Fu. The scripts that
      come with <acronym>GIMP</acronym> can be quite useful, but they can also
      serve as models
      for learning Script-Fu, or at least as a framework and source of
      modification when you make your own script. Read the Script-Fu Tutorial
      in the next section if you want to learn more about how to make scripts.
    </para>
    <para>
      We will describe some of the most useful scripts in this chapter, but we
      won't cover them all. There are simply too many scripts. Some of the
      scripts are also very simple and you will probably not need any
      documentation to be able to use them.
    </para>
    <para>
      Script-Fu (a dialect of Scheme) isn't the only scripting language
      available for <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. But Script-Fu is the only
      scripting language that is
      installed by default. Other available scripting extensions are Perl and
      Tcl. You can download and install both extensions at the
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> Plugin
      Registry <xref linkend="bibliography-online-gimp-plugin-registry"/>.

    <para>
      One of the great things about Script-Fu is that you can share your
      script with all your <acronym>GIMP</acronym> friends. There are many
      scripts that come with <acronym>GIMP</acronym> by default, but
      there are also vast quantities of scripts that are
      available for download all around the Internet.

          If you have downloaded a script, copy or move it to your
          scripts directory. It can be found in the
          <link linkend="gimp-prefs-folders">Preferences</link>:
          <menuchoice>

          from the image menubar.
          The script will now appear in one of your menus.
          If you don't find it, look for it under the root file menu
          filters. If it doesn't appear at all, something was wrong with
          the script (e.g. it contains syntax errors).

      A common error when you are dealing with Script-Fus is that you simply
      bring them up and press the OK button. When nothing happens, you
      probably think that the script is broken or buggy, but there is most
      likely nothing wrong with it.

            Menus have been reorganized. A new Colors-menu appears. It groups
            together all scripts that work on colors, for example tools that
            adjust hue, saturation, lightness..., filters...etc. Filters-menu
            and Script-Fu-menu are merged in one Filters-menu and it is
            organized according to new categories. Image-dependent Plug-ins and
            Script-Fus are now disseminated in the image-menus. For example,
            Color to Alpha filter is in Colors-menu. At the beginning, it's
            disconcerting, but you finish to get used to this because it's more
            logical.

      We will not try to describe every script in depth. Most Script-Fus are
      very easy to understand and use. At the time of this writing, the
      following types are installed by default:

          <para>
            You will find all kinds of pattern-generating scripts here.
            Generally, they are quite useful because you can add many
            arguments to your own patterns.
          </para>
          <para>
            We'll take a look at the Land script. In this script you have to
            set the image/pattern size, and specify what levels of random to
            use for your land creation. The colors used to generate the land
            map are taken from the currently selected gradient in the gradient
            editor. You must also supply values for the level of detail, land
            and sea height/depth and the scale. Scale refers to the scale of
            your map, just as in an ordinary road map, 1:10 will be typed as
            10.

            Here is clearly a practical use for scripts. By creating a script
            for making custom text, logos, buttons arrows, etc., for your web
            site, you will give them all the same style and shape. You will
            also be saving a lot of time, because you don't have to create
            every logo, text or button by hand.
          </para>
          <para>
            Most of the scripts are quite self-explanatory, but here are some

            Here you will find all kinds of logo-generating scripts. This is
            nice, but use it with care, as people might recognize your logo as
            being made by a known <acronym>GIMP</acronym> script. You should
            rather regard it as
            a base that you can modify to fit your needs. The dialog for
            making a logo is more or less the same for all such scripts:

            Under this headline you'll find two scripts that makes rectangular
            beveled buttons, with or without round corners (Round Button or
            Simple Beveled Button). They have a dozen parameters or so, and
            most of them are similar to those in the logo scripts. You can
            experiment with different settings to come up with a button you
            like.

      Now, scripts and filters that perform operations on an existing image are
      accessible directly by the appropriate menu. For example, the script
      <guimenu>New Brush</guimenu> (script-fu-paste-as-brush)
      is integrated in the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> image menu
      (<menuchoice>

        <guimenuitem>Paste as...</guimenuitem>

      that is more logical.

      Furthermore, a new <guimenu>Color</guimenu> menu has been created that

      <guimenu>Filters</guimenu> menu and <guimenu>Scripts-Fu</guimenu> menu are

      nearby in the menu.

    <para>
      The <guimenu>Scripts-Fu</guimenu> menu only appears if you have loaded
      additional scripts: for example the gimp-resynthesizer pack corresponding

      <filename class="extension">.rpm</filename>,
