    The <link linkend="gimp-tools-selection">selection tools</link>
    sometimes show their limits when they have to be used for creating a
    complex selection. In these cases, using the QuickMask can make
    things much easier.  Simply put, the QuickMask allows you to paint a
    selection instead of just tracing its outline.

    </title>
    <para>
      Normally when you create a selection in GIMP, you see it represented by
      the "marching ants" that trace along its outline. But really there may
      be a lot more to a selection than the marching ants show you: in GIMP a
      selection is actually a full-fledged grayscale channel, covering the
      image, with pixel values ranging from 0 (unselected) to 255 (fully
      selected). The marching ants are drawn along a contour of half-selected
      pixels. Thus, what the marching ants show you as either inside or
      outside the boundary is really just a slice through a continuum.
    </para>
    <para>
      The QuickMask is GIMP's way of showing you the full structure of the
      selection. Activating it also gives you the ability to interact with the
      selection in new, and substantially more powerful, ways. To activate the
      QuickMask, click on the small red-outlined button at the lower left of
      the image window. The button is a toggle, so clicking it again will
      return you to normal marching-ant mode. You can also activate the
      QuickMask by selecting in the image window menu
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Select</guimenu><guimenuitem>Toggle QuickMask</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or by using the
      <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>Q</keycap></keycombo>
      shortcut.
    </para>
    <para>
      Activating the QuickMask shows you the selection as though it were a
      translucent screen overlying the image, whose transparency at each pixel
      indicates the degree to which that pixel is selected. By default the
      mask is shown in red, but you can change this if another mask color
      would be more convenient. The less a pixel is selected, the more it is
      obscured by the mask. Fully selected pixels are shown completely clear.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you are in QuickMask mode, many image manipulations act on the
      selection channel rather than the image itself. This includes, in
      particular, paint tools. Painting with white causes the painted
      pixels to be selected; painting with black causes them to be
      unselected. You can use any of the paint tools, as well as the bucket
      fill and gradient fill tools, in this way. Advanced users of GIMP
      learn that <quote>painting the selection</quote> is the easiest and
      most effective way to delicately manipulate it.
    </para>
    <tip>
      <para>
        To save the selection done by the Quickmask to a new channel; Make
        sure that there is a selection and that Quickmask is not active in
        the image window. Select in the image menu
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Save to Channel</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        This will create a new channel in the channel dialog called
        <quote>SelectionMask copy</quote> (if you repeat this command you
        will create a <quote>..copy#1</quote>, <quote>...copy#2</quote> and
        so on...).
      </para>
    </tip>
    <tip>
      <para>
        When QuickMask is active, Cut and Paste act on the selection rather
        than the image. You can sometimes make use of this as the most
        convenient way of transferring a selection from one image to another.

        There are two QuickMask properties you can change by right-clicking
        on the QuickMask button.

            Normally the QuickMask shows unselected areas <quote>fogged over
            </quote> and selected areas <quote>in clear</quote>, but you can
            reverse this by choosing <quote>Mask Selected Areas</quote>
            instead of the default <quote>Mask Unselected Areas</quote>.

          By choosing <quote>Configure Color and Opacity</quote>, you can
          bring up a dialog that allows you to set these to values other
          than the defaults, which are red at 50% opacity.
