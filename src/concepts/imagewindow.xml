    <para>
      An image window exists, even if no image is open.
      The Title Bar in an image window without an image reads
      <quote>GNU Image Manipulating Program</quote>.
      An image window with an image displays the image name
      and its specifications in the title bar according to the settings
      in <link linkend="gimp-prefs-dialog">Preference Dialog</link>.
      Each window displays exactly one image, or no image if no image is
      open. Each image is displayed in one or more image windows;
      it is unusual to display the same image in more than one window.
      We will begin with a brief description of the
      components that are present by default in an ordinary image window.
      Some of the components can be removed by using commands in the
      <link linkend="gimp-imagewindow-menus-view">View</link>
      menu.
    </para>
    <listitem>
      <!--1-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Title Bar:</emphasis>
        The top of the image window typically displays a Title Bar with
        the name of the image and some basic information about the image. The
        Title Bar is provided by the operating system, not by
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>, so its appearance is likely to vary with
        the operating system, window manager, and/or theme. Use the
        <link linkend="gimp-prefs-dialog">Preferences dialog</link>
        to customize the information that appears in the Title Bar.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--2-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Image Menu:</emphasis>
        Directly below the Title Bar appears the Image Menu (unless it has
        been suppressed). The Image Menu provides access to nearly every
        operation you can perform on an image. You can also right-click
        on an image to display a pop-up image menu.
        <footnote><para>
            Users with an Apple Macintosh and a one button mouse can use
            <keycombo>
              <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
              <mousebutton>mousebutton</mousebutton>
            </keycombo> instead.
          </para></footnote>,
        or by left-clicking on the little <quote>arrow</quote> symbol in
        the upper left corner, called the <emphasis>Menu Button:</emphasis>,
        if for some reason you find one of these more
        convenient. Many menu commands are also associated with keyboard
        <emphasis>shortcuts</emphasis> as shown in the menu.
        You can define your own custom shortcuts for menu actions, if
        you enable <link linkend="gimp-prefs-interface"> Use Dynamic Keyboard
          Shortcuts</link> in the Preferences dialog.

      <para>
        <emphasis>Menu Button:</emphasis>
        Click the Menu Button to display the Image Menu in a column.
        If you like to use keyboard shortcuts, use
        <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>F10</keycap></keycombo>
        to open the menu.

      <anchor id="gimp-image-window-ruler"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Ruler:</emphasis>
        In the default layout, rulers are shown above and to the left of the
        image. Use the rulers to determine coordinates within the image.
        The default unit for rulers is pixels; use the settings
        described below to use a unit other than pixels.
      </para>
      <para>
        One of the most important uses of rulers is to create
        <emphasis>guides</emphasis>.
        Click and drag a ruler into the image to create a guide.
        A guide is a line that helps you accurately position
        things&mdash;or verify that another line is truly horizontal
        or vertical.
        Click and drag a guide to move it. Drag a guide out of the
        image to delete it; you can always drag another guide into the
        image. You can even use multiple guides at the same time.
      </para>

      <anchor id="quick-mask-toggle"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>QuickMask Toggle:</emphasis>
        The small button in the lower left corner of the image toggles the
        Quick Mask on and off. When the Quick Mask is on, the button is
        outlined in red. See <link linkend="gimp-qmask">QuickMask</link>
        for more details on this highly useful tool.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--6-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Pointer Coordinates:</emphasis>
        When the pointer (mouse cursor, if you are using a mouse) is
        within the image boundaries, the rectangular area in the lower
        left corner of the window displays the current pointer
        coordinates. The units are the same as for the rulers.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--7-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Units Menu:</emphasis>
        Use the Units Menu to change the units used for rulers and several
        other purposes. The default unit is pixels, but you can quickly
        change to inches, cm, or several other possibilities using this menu.
        Note that the setting of
        <quote>Dot for dot</quote> in the View menu affects how the display is
        scaled: see <link linkend="gimp-view-dot-for-dot">Dot for Dot</link>
        for more information.

      <anchor id="gimp-image-window-zoom"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Zoom Button:</emphasis>
        There are a number of ways to zoom the image in or out, but the Zoom
        Button is perhaps the simplest. With GIMP-2.6, you can directly enter
        a zoom level in the text box for very fine control.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--9-->
      <anchor id="gimp-image-window-status-bar"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Status Area:</emphasis>
        The Status Area is at the bottom of the image window.
        By default, the Status Area displays the active part of the image,
        and the amount of system memory used by the image.Use
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
          <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu>
          <guimenuitem>Image Windows</guimenuitem>
          <guimenuitem>Title &amp; Status</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        to customize the information displayed in the Status Area.
        During time-consuming operations, the status area temporarily
        shows the running operation and how complete the operation is.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          Note that the memory used by the image is very
          different from the image file size. For instance, a 70Kb .PNG
          image may occupy 246Kb in memory when displayed.
          There are two primary reasons the difference in memory usage.
          First, a .PNG file is compressed format, and the image is
          reconstituted in memory in uncompressed form.
          Second, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> uses extra memory, and copies
          of the image, for use by the Undo command.
        </para>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--10-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Cancel Button:</emphasis>
        During complex time-consuming operations, usually a plug-in,
        a Cancel button temporarily appears in the lower right corner
        of the window. Use the Cancel button to stop the operation.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          A few plug-ins respond badly to being canceled, sometimes
          leaving corrupted pieces of images behind.

      </indexterm>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Navigation Control:</emphasis>
        This is a small cross-shaped button at the lower right corner of the
        image display. Click and hold (do not release the mouse button)
        on the navigation control to display the Navigation Preview.
        The Navigation Preview has a miniature view of the image
        with the displayed area outlined. Use the Navigation Preview
        To quickly pan to a different part of the
        image&mdash;move the mouse while keeping the button depressed.
        The Navigation Window is often the most convenient way to
        quickly navigate around a large image with only a small portion
        displayed. (See
        <link linkend="gimp-navigation-dialog">Navigation Dialog</link>
        for other ways to access the Navigation Window). (If your mouse has a
        middle-button, click-drag with it to pan across the image).

      <!--12-->
      <para>
        <emphasis>Inactive Padding Area:</emphasis>
        This padding area separates the active image display and the inactive
        padding area, so you're able to distinguish between them. You cannot
        apply any Filters or Operations in general to the inactive area.

      <anchor id="imagewindow-display"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Image Display:</emphasis>
        The most important part of the image window is, of course, the image
        display or canvas. It occupies the central area of the window,
        surrounded by a yellow dotted line showing the image boundary, against
        a neutral gray background. You can change the zoom level of the image
        display in a variety of ways, including the Zoom setting described
        below.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <!--14-->
      <anchor id="gimp-image-window-zoom-follow-button"/>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Image Window Resize Toggle:</emphasis>
        Without enabling this feature, if you change the size of the image
        window, the image size and zoom does not change. If you make the
        window larger, for example, then you will see more of the image.
        If this button is pressed, however, the image resizes when the window
        resizes so that (mostly) the same portion of the image is displayed
        before and after the window is resized.
