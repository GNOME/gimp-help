  <para>
    There are several ways of opening an existing image in
    <acronym>GIMP</acronym>:
  </para>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-open-file">
    <title>Open File</title>
    <para>
      The most obvious is to open it using a menu, by choosing
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      from an image menu. This brings up a File Browser dialog, allowing you
      to navigate to the file and click on its name. This method works well
      if you know the name of the file you want to open, and where it is
      located. It is not so convenient if you want to find the file on the
      basis of a thumbnail.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        When you open a file, using the File menu or any other method,
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
        needs to determine what type of file it is. Unless there is no
        alternative, <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
        does not simply rely on the extension (such as ".jpg") to determine the
        file type, because extensions are not reliable: they vary from system to
        system; any file can be renamed to have any extension; and there are
        many reasons why a file name might lack an extension. Instead,
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
        first tries to recognize a file by examining its contents: most of the
        commonly used graphics file formats have "magic headers" that permit
        them to be recognized. Only if the magic yields no result does
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym> resort to using the extension.
      </para>

    <para>
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      2.2 introduced a new File Chooser that provides several features to help
      you navigate quickly to the file you are looking for. Perhaps the most
      important is the ability to create <quote>bookmarks</quote>
      for folders that you use often. Your list of bookmarks appears on the
      left side of the dialog. The ones at the top ( <quote>Home</quote>,
      <quote>Desktop</quote>, etc) come automatically; the
      others you create using the <quote>Add</quote>
      button at the bottom of the list. Double-clicking on a bookmark takes
      you straight to that directory.
    </para>
    <para>
      At the center of the dialog appears a listing of the contents of the
      selected directory. Subdirectories are shown at the top of the list,
      files below them. By default all files in the directory are listed, but
      you can restrict the listing to image files of a specific type using the
      File Type selection menu that appears beneath the directory listing.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you click on a file entry in the listing, if it is an image file, a
      preview will appear on the right side of the dialog, along with some
      basic information about the properties of the image. Note that previews
      are cached when they are generated, and there are some things you can do
      that may cause a preview to be incorrect. If you suspect that this may
      be happening, you can force a new preview to be generated by holding
      down the Ctrl key and clicking in the Preview area.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default, a <guilabel>Location</guilabel> text box is present in the
      File Open dialog. It may be absent: the
      <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>L</keycap></keycombo> key
      combination toggles this text box.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        In the great majority of cases, if you select a file name from the
        list, and click the <quote>Open</quote> button in the lower right
        corner or the dialog, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> will automatically
        determine the file type for you.  On rare occasions, mainly if the
        file type is unusual and the name lacks a meaningful extension,
        this may fail. If this happens, you can tell
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym> specifically what type of file it is by
        expanding the <quote>Select File Typ</quote> option at the bottom
        of the dialog, and choosing an entry from the list that appears.
        More commonly, though, if <acronym>GIMP</acronym> fails to open an
        image file, it is either corrupt or not in a supported format.

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-open-location">
    <title>Open Location</title>
    <para>
      If instead of a file name, you have a <acronym>URI</acronym>
      (i.e., a web address) for the image, you can open it using the
      menu, by choosing
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Open Locationâ€¦</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      from an image menu.  This brings up a small dialog that allows you to
      enter (or paste) the <acronym>URI</acronym>.

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-open-recent">
    <title>Open Recent</title>
    <para>
      If the image is one that you previously created using
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>,
      perhaps the easiest way to open it is from the menu, using
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Open Recent</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>.
      This gives you a scrollable list of the images you
      have most recently worked on in, with icons beside them.
      You need only select the one you want, and it will be
      opened.

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-external-programs">
    <title>Using External Programs</title>
    <para>
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> uses plugins for reading and writing graphics
      file formats except XCF. These plugins may use external libraries or
      programs. For example, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> does not support
      <link linkend="glossary-postscript">PostScript</link> directly. Instead,
      for reading (or writing) PostScript files (file extension
      <filename class="extension">.ps</filename> or
      <filename class="extension">.eps</filename>) <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      requires a powerful free software program called
      <application>Ghostscript</application>.

        Installing <application>Ghostscript</application>

      <para>
        Linux distributions almost always come with Ghostscript already
        installed (not necessarily the most recent version). For other
        operating systems, you may have to install it yourself. Here are
        instructions for installing it on Windows:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Go to the Ghostscript project page on Sourceforge
            <xref linkend="bibliography-online-ghostscript"/>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <!--PENDING DocBook 4.4.: replace <application> with <package>-->
          <para>
            Look for the package <application>gnu-gs</application> or
            <application>ghostscript</application> (for non-commercial
            use only) and go to the download section.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Download one of the prepared Windows distributions, such as
            <filename>gs650w32.exe</filename> or
            <filename>gs700w32.exe</filename>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Start the executable and follow the instructions of the
            installation procedure.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Set the <envar>GS_PROG</envar> environment variable to the full
            file name of the gswin32c binary  (e.g.
            <filename>C:\gs\gsX.YY\bin\gswin32c.exe</filename>).
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        Now you should be able to read PostScript files with
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. Please note that you must not move the
        Ghostscript directories once the installation is complete. The
        installation creates registry entries which allow Ghostscript to find
        its libraries. (These instructions courtesy of
        http://www.kirchgessner.net.)

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-file-manager">
    <title>File Manager</title>
    <para>
      If you have associated the file type of the image with
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>,
      either when you installed <acronym>GIMP</acronym> or later, then you
      can navigate to the file using a file manager (such as Nautilus or
      Konqueror in Linux, or Windows Explorer in Windows), and once you
      have found it, double-click on the icon.  If things are set up
      properly, this will cause the image to open in
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-drag-and-drop">
    <title>Drag and Drop</title>
    <para>
      Alternatively, once you have found the file, you can click on
      its icon and drag it into the  <acronym>GIMP</acronym> Toolbox.
      (If instead you drag it into an existing  <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      image, it will be added to that image as a new layer or set of
      layers).
    </para>
    <para>
      For many applications, you can click on a displayed image (a
      full image, not just a thumbnail) and drag it into the
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      toolbox.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="gimp-using-open-copy-and-paste">
    <title>Copy and Paste</title>
    <para>
      For some applications, if the application gives you a
      way of copying the image to the clipboard (on some systems, the
      <keycap>Print Screen</keycap> key lets you copy the screen into
      the clipboard), you can then open
      the image in <acronym>GIMP</acronym> by choosing
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>File</guimenu>
        <guisubmenu>Create</guisubmenu>
        <guimenuitem>From Clipboard</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
      from the image menu.  Support for this is somewhat
      variable, however, so your best bet is to try it and see
      whether it works.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2  id="gimp-using-image-browser">
    <title>Image Browser</title>
    <para>
      In Linux, you might want to take a look at a program called
      <application>gThumb</application>, an image-management
      application that in several ways nicely complements
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym>.  In <application>gThumb</application>,
      you can cause an image to open in <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
      either by right-clicking on the icon and selecting
      <acronym>GIMP</acronym> from among the list of options, or by
      dragging the icon into the GIMP toolbox.
      See the gThumb home page <xref linkend="bibliography-online-gthumb"/>
      for more information. Other similar applications are : GQview
      <xref linkend="bibliography-online-gqview"/>, XnView
