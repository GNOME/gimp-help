    A <emphasis>gradient</emphasis>
    is a set of colors arranged in a linear order. The most basic use of
    gradients is by the <link linkend="gimp-tool-blend">Blend tool</link>,
    sometimes known as the <quote>gradient tool</quote> or <quote>gradient
    fill tool</quote>: it works
    by filling the selection with colors from a gradient. You have many
    options to choose from for controlling the way the gradient colors are
    arranged within the selection. There are also other important ways to use
    gradients, including:

          Each of GIMP's basic painting tools allows you the option of using
          colors from a gradient. This enables you to create brushstrokes that
          change color from one end to the other.

           progressively until the intensity is 255, very light, replaced by
           the most right color of the gradient. See

    When you install GIMP, it comes presupplied with a large number of
    interesting gradients, and you can add new ones that you create or
    download from other sources. You can access the full set of available
    gradients using the
    <link linkend="gimp-gradient-dialog">Gradients dialog</link>,
    a dockable dialog that you can either activate when you need it, or keep
    around as a tab in a dock. The <quote>current gradient</quote>, used in
    most gradient-related operations, is shown in the Brush/Pattern/Gradient
    area of the Toolbox. Clicking on the gradient symbol in the Toolbox is an
    alternative way of bringing up the Gradients dialog.

        The first four gradients in the list are special:  they use the
        Foreground and Background colors from the Toolbox Color Area,
        instead of being fixed. <guilabel>FG to BG (RGB)</guilabel> is the
        RGB representation of the gradient from the Foreground color to the
        Background color in Toolbox. <guilabel>FG to BG (HSV
        counter-clockwise) </guilabel> represents the hue succession in
        Color Circle from the selected hue to 360°. <guilabel>FG to BG
        (HSV clockwise</guilabel> represents the hue succession in Color
        Circle from the selected hue to 0°. With <guilabel>FG to transparent
        </guilabel>, the selected hue becomes more and more transparent. You
        can modify these colors by using the Color Selector. Thus, by
        altering the foreground and background colors, you can make these
        gradients transition smoothly between any two colors you want.

        Gradients can involve not just color changes, but also changes in
        opacity. Some of the gradients are completely opaque; others include
        transparent or translucent parts. When you fill or paint with a
        non-opaque gradient, the existing contents of the layer will show
        through behind it.

        You can create new <emphasis>custom</emphasis> gradients,
        using the <link linkend="gimp-gradient-editor-dialog">Gradient
        Editor</link>.  You cannot modify the gradients that are
        supplied with GIMP, but you can duplicate them or create new
        ones, and then edit those.
      </para>

  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    The gradients that are supplied with GIMP are stored in a system
    <filename>gradients</filename> folder.  By default, gradients that
    you create are stored in a folder called
    <filename>gradients</filename> in your personal GIMP directory.
    Any gradient files (ending with the extension
    <filename>.ggr</filename>) found in one of these folders, will
    automatically be loaded when you start GIMP.  You can add more
    directories to the gradient search path, if you want to, in the
    Gradients tab of the <link linkend="gimp-prefs-folders-data">Data
    Folders</link> pages of the Preferences dialog.
  </para>
  <para>
    New in GIMP 2.2 is the ability to load gradient files in SVG format, used
    by many vector graphics programs. To make GIMP load an SVG gradient file,
    all you need to do is place it in the <filename>gradients</filename>
    folder of your personal GIMP directory, or any other folder in your
    gradient search path.
  </para>
  <tip>
    <para>
      You can find a large number of interesting SVG gradients on the web, in
      particular at OpenClipArt Gradients
      <xref linkend="bibliography-online-openclipart-gradients"/>.
      You won't be able to see what these gradients look like unless your
      browser supports SVG, but that won't prevent you from downloading them.
