      <para>
        The Lab color space (also called the L*a*b color space) is a
        <link linkend="glossary-colormodel">color model</link>
        developed in the beginning of the 1930s by the Commission
        Internationale d`Eclairage (CIE). It includes all the colors that
        the human eye can perceive. That contains the colors of the
        RGB and the CMYK color spaces, among others. In Lab, a color is
        indicated by three values: L, a and b. Here, the L stands for the
        luminance component — corresponding to the gray value — and a and b
        represent the red-green and blue-yellow parts of the color,
        respectively.

      <para>
        In contrast to RGB or CMYK, Lab is not dependent upon the
        various input and output devices. For that reason, it is used as an
        exchange format between devices. Lab is also the internal color
        model of PostScript Level II.

      <para>
        You can think of layers as being a stack of slides which are more or
        less transparent. Each layer represents an aspect of the image and
        the image is the sum of all of these aspects. The layer at the bottom
        of the stack is the background layer. The layers above it are the
        components of the foreground.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can view and manage the layers of the image through the
        <link linkend="gimp-layer-dialog">Layers dialog</link>.
