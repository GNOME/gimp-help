        A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that
        serves to identify an abstract or a physical resource. URIs are used
        for the identification of resources in the Internet (such as web
        pages, miscellaneous files, calling up web services, and for receivers
        of e-mail) and they are especially used in the Worldwide Web.

      <para>
        URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are one type of Uniform Resource
        Identifiers (URIs). URLs identify a resource by its primary access
        mechanism (commonly http or ftp) and the location of the resource in
        the computer network. The name of the URI scheme is therefore
        generally derived from the network protocol used for it. Examples of
        network protocols are http, ftp and mailto.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since URLs are the first and most common kinds of URIs, the terms are
        often used synonymously.
