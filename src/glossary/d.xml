        Dithering refers to the math and voodoo involved in renderingan
        image that has few colors seem like it has many. Dithering is
        accomplished in different ways depending on the output device
        and
        the program. One particularly effective method is clustering
        pixels of color together in an attempt to simulate another
        color.
        This is achieved by the human eye and the tendency for it tomix
        colors while viewing complex color patterns. A common dithering
        effect is seen on television screens or in newspaper print.From
        a distance the images seem to be constructed of many varied
        colors or shades, but upon closer inspection this is certainly
        not the case. A color television uses only three colors
        clustered
        together in various states of on or off. A black and white
        newspaper uses only black ink, yet pictures in newspapersappear
        to be constructed of grey tones. Furthermore, there are
        techniques used to achieve greater success in dithering.

        The GIMP can use the Floyd-Steinberg dithering technique, for
        example.  This dithering method is simply put, a mathematical way
        of clustering the pixels to accomplish better results thanother
        dithering methods. Of course, there are always exceptions and
        there are many different dithering models that are in usetoday.
