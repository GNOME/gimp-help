      <para>
        JPEG is a <link linkend="glossary-fileformat">file format</link>
        which supports compression and works at all color depths. The
        image compression is adjustable, but beware: Too high a compression
        could severely reduce image quality, since JPEG compression is lossy.
      </para>
      <para>
        Use JPEG to create web graphics or if you don't want your
        image to take up a lot of space. JPEG is a good format for
        photographs and for computer-generated images (CGI). It is not well
        suited for:

            digital line drawings (for example, screenshots or vector

      <para>
        Other formats, such as GIF, PNG or JBIG, are far better for these
        kinds of images.

      <para>
        In general, JPEG transformations are not reversible. Opening and
        then saving a JPEG file causes a new, lossy compression. Increasing
        the quality factor later will not bring back the image information
        which was lost.
