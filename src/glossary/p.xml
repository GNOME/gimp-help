      <para>
        A Parasite is additional data which may be written to an XCF file. A
        parasite is identified by a name, and can be thought of as an
        extension to the other information in an XCF file.
      </para>
      <para>
        Parasites of an image component may be read by
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>
        plug-ins. Plug-ins may also define their own parasite names, which are
        ignored by other plug-ins. Examples of parasites are comments, the
        save options for the TIFF, JPEG and PNG file formats, the gamma value
        the image was created with and EXIF data.

        A Path is a contour composed of straight lines, curves, or both. In

        selection, or to be <emphasis>stroked</emphasis> to create visible
        marks on an image. Unless a path is stroked, it is not visible when
        the image is printed and it is not saved when the image is written
        to a file (unless you use XCF format).

        PDF (Portable Document Format) is a

        developed by Adobe to address some of the deficiencies of
        PostScript. Most importantly, PDF files tend to be much smaller than

        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>'s support of the PDF format is through the
        free Ghostscript libraries.

    <glossdef>
      <para>
        Created by Adobe, PostScript is a page description language mainly
        used by printers and other output devices. It's also an excellent way
        to distribute documents. <acronym>GIMP</acronym> does not support
        PostScript directly: it depends on a powerful free software program
        called Ghostscript.
      </para>
      <para>
        The great power of PostScript is its ability to represent vector
        graphics—lines, curves, text, paths, etc.—in a resolution-independent
        way. PostScript is not very efficient, though, when it comes to
        representing pixel-based raster graphics. For this reason, PostScript
        is not a good format to use for saving images that are later going to
        be edited using <acronym>GIMP</acronym> or another graphics program.
      </para>
      <para>
        Linux distributions almost always come with Ghostscript already
        installed (not necessarily the most recent version). For other
        operating systems, you may have to install it yourself. Here are
        instructions for installing it on Windows:

            Copy the executable gswin32c.exe from the bin directory of the
            Ghostscript installation to the Windows directory (or any other
            directory that is contained in the PATH). As an alternative,
            advanced users can set an environment variable, GS_PROG, to point
            to gswin32c.exe (e.g. C:\gs\gsX.YY\bin\gswin32c.exe).
          </para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        Now you should be able to read PostScript files with
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym>. Please note
        that you must not move the Ghostscript directories once the
        installation is complete. The installation creates registry entries
        which allow Ghostscript to find its libraries. (These instructions
        courtesy of http://www.kirchgessner.net.)

        PNG is the acronym of <quote>Portable Network Graphic</quote>
        (pronounce <quote>ping</quote>. This recent format offers many
        advantages and a few drawbacks: it is not lossy and gives files
        more heavy than the JPEG format, but it is perfect for saving your
        images because you can save them several times without losing
        data each time (it is used for this Help). It supports True Colors
        (several millions of colors), indexed images (256 colors like GIF),
        and 256 transparency levels (while GIF supports only two levels).
