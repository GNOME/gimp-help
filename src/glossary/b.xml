        A spline is a curve which is defined mathematically and has a set
        of control points. A Bezier spline is a cubic spline which has
        four control points, where the first and last control points
        (knots or anchors) are the endpoints of the curve and the inner
        two control points (handles) determine the direction of the curve
        at the endpoints.

      <para>
        In the non-mathematical sense, a spline is a flexible strip of
        wood or metal used for drawing curves. Using this type of spline
        for drawing curves dates back to shipbuilding, where weights were
        hung on splines to bend them. The outer control points of a
        Bezier spline are similar to the places where the splines are
        fastened down and the inner control points are where weights are
        attached to modify the curve.

      <para>
        Bezier splines are only one way of mathematically representing
        curves. They were developed in the 1960s by Pierre Bezier, who
        worked for Renault.

        The image above shows a Bezier curve. Points P0 and P3 are points
        on the Path, which are created by clicking with the mouse. Points
        P1 and P2 are handles, which are automatically created by
        <acronym>GIMP</acronym> when you click on the line between P0 and
        P3 and stretch it. They change position when you stretch the
        curve in different ways.

        curves on either side of it.

        <blockquote>
          <para>
            bitmap — A data file or structure which corresponds bit for bit
            with an image displayed on a screen, probably in the same format
            as it would be stored in the display's video memory or maybe as a
            device independent bitmap. A bitmap is characterised by the width
            and height of the image in pixels and the number of bits per pixel
            which determines the number of shades of grey or colours it can
            represent. A bitmap representing a coloured image (a
            <quote>pixmap</quote>
            ) will usually have pixels with between one and eight bits for
            each of the red, green, and blue components, though other colour
            encodings are also used. The green component sometimes has more
            bits than the other two to cater for the human eye's greater
            discrimination in this component.

        typically represented in 1, 4 or 8 bits, although the format also

        it is not very well suited for use in the internet.

      <para>
        Bump mapping is a technique for displaying extremely detailed objects
        without increasing the geometrical complexity of the objects. It is
        especially used in 3-dimensional visualization programs. The trick is
        to put all the necessary information into a texture, with which
        shadowing is shown on the surface of the object.
      </para>
      <para>
        Bump mapping is only one (very effective) way of simulating surface
        irregularities which are not actually contained in the geometry of the
        model.
