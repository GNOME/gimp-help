Status of the GIMP-help-2 module
================================

0. What happened so far?
------------------------

The development on the original gimp-help modules came pretty much to a
stop after the first few stable versions of GIMP 1.2 were released. This is
due to several reasons, one of them being that all of the original
documentation had been converted from HTML to DocBook/SGML and apart from a
bit new content, lots of markup and proofreading not too much happened to
the organisation of the complete mess.

We (syngin and prof) that is, are not too happy about the quirks we had to
go through to make the new help behave very much the same as the old help
in its limited usability.

Among other reasons this was about the most severe one that de-focused us
a bit.

A (fair) bit later syngin spoke to me (prof) and asked if it would be okay to
start completely from scratch; wipe out everything and start with a bunch
of new ideas (which this document will hopefully mention at some time :));
so here we go and I'll try to explain a few of the new ideas we have in
mind before we really start over.


1. Prerequisites
----------------
- DocBook XML it is (or will be)
- Formatting will be done by XSLT
- The help-plugin will pick up a mapping file and use it

After all the goals still are to get kick-ass documentation for the GIMP
which will be usable as online help over the helpbrowser, standalone in
a HTML-browser faciliating cutting-edge technology like XHTML and CSS
as well as highest quality printing material.


2. The team
-----------
As is there are syngin (Mel Boyce <syngin@gimp.org>) 
and prof (Daniel Egger<degger@fhm.edu>) as the team lead. 
While syngin will take care of the content, prof's main area of activity
will be the technical realisation and organisation.

So far other people have expressed some interest in helping out and
they'll be introduced while we keep going.


2. Ideas
--------
This is the part where you may kick in; if you have any ideas tell
us and they'll show up here.

So far we have:
- Multiple format support: Obviously it is a must have to sport several
  different output formats.
- Segregated index lists: To remove the need to stick to exactly specified
  filenames the plugin will be driven by index files which tell what 
  file in which language and/or format will be used.
- Application callbacks: Control the GIMP over special formed links which
  allow firing up events from the helpbrowser; like in Windows(tm):
  "Click HERE to format drive C:".
- Eye candy: We need lots of screen shots and if possible create images 
  dynamically over application callbacks.
- Homepage: Every serious project has one, so we need one, too. :)

3. Timeframe
------------
Obviously we don't need one. :) Seriously though, we haven't even started
due to lack of time but we're in a hot planning phase and hope to get
something done in sooner or later. We're not aiming at providing
documentation for GIMP 1.2.x, this is what good ol' gimp-help is for.
GIMP 1.3 is still in development and also lacks a timeframe but I'd shoot
for early 1.4.x whenever that'll be.

So long, so far, Yours,
Mel Boyce and Daniel Egger
