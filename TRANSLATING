How To Add a New Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the git://git.gnome.org/gimp-help-2 repository.

2. Open 'configure.ac' file in a text editor.

3. Got to this line:

ALL_LINGUAS="ca da de el en en_GB es fr it ja ko nl nn pt_BR ro ru zh_CN"

4. Add a two-letter or four-letter code for your language, e.g. 'ro' for
Romanian or 'es_MX' for Spanish (Mexico). Save the file.

5. Run './autogen.sh' to generate a Makefile.

6. Run 'make po-LANG' to generate PO files for your langauge, where LANG
is either the two-letter or four-letter code that you added.


How To Translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use any PO editor you prefer (poEdit, Gtranslator, Lokalize etc.) to open
and translate PO files create at the previous step. Don't forget to fill
in basic metadata like translator's name and email address.

How To Test Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run 'make html-LANG', where LANG is your two/four-letter language code,
to generate HTML version of the user manual.

How To Add Localized Screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All images are stored in the top-level 'images' folder. Original
screenshots in English are in the 'C' subfolder. Localized screenshots
are in 'LANG' folders, where LANG is your two/four-letter language code.

It's important to preserve both paths and names when saving localized
versions of the screenshots. Otherwise documentation won't build properly,
if at all.

How To Submit Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple ways to submit your translation depending on the access
level you have for the Git repository. 

If you cloned the Git repository anonymously, and you intend to either send
the files to your GNOME i18n team or submit a patch to the bug tracker, do
this:

1. Add all the files you created ('git add') and commit them ('git commit').

2. Run 'git pull --rebase' to sync your local copy to the main remote Git
repository.

3. Run 'git format-patch origin/master' to generate Git-formatted patch 
(or patches).

4. Submit newly create files.

If you cloned the Git repository via SSH, it means you already have the
access to push directly to the remote repository. Simply run add and commit
all your changes, then run 'git push origin master'.
