GIMP Help release 3.0.0
=======================

This is our first release of the manual for GIMP version 3.0.

Documentation has been updated on almost all pages of the manual to reflect
changes made in GIMP. The Import, Export and Preferences dialogs are now
listed under Dialogs.
In addition to that Andre Klapper did a lot of work was done to reduce the
amount of duplication in the text and images used, reducing the amount of
work for translators.

A lot of effort was put into updating the manual, but we are not finished yet.
There are still some documentation pages missing, mainly for the import and
export dialogs, and there are still parts of our manual that need improving.
Since this is a volunteer community effort, we would welcome more people
to help us make this manual better.

Known issues
------------
Packagers, be aware that validating will fail for the Greek and Russian
translations of the manual if you use a libxml2 version below 2.11.0.
If you do not use make validate, building should succeed, except the languages
mentioned above will have one of their pages empty (except a could not
translate warning).

GIMP Help release 2.10.34
=========================

This release has been long overdue. Although we published a 2.10.0 test release,
which eventually became the de facto first 2.10 release, it was never meant
to be an official release. Due to the lack of volunteers and the amount of
documentation needing updates, getting this up-to-date took way longer than
we wanted, but finally we are there!

A lot of improvements have been made to the infrastructure, to make building
and automated testing possible. We upgraded our build to use Python 3, we
improved error checking, and we modernized our website to be more in line with
the main GIMP website and give better information.

New automated builds are published to our website once a day, which means that
the online documentation and translations always are the most recent. Even
better, our website now shows the completion status for each language. A lot
of languages still need considerable work. If you would like to help improve
that, please visit https://docs.gimp.org/help.html for more information.
The links to the quickreference PDF guides were fixed and the guides themselves
were updated.

Large parts of the documentation have been updated, but there are still areas
that need improvements. We also need to start working on all that has changed
for the upcoming GIMP 3.0 release. More helping hands would be very welcome.

We updated our AUTHORS categories to the hopefully more understandable division
between documenters and translators. We also updated the list of contributors
(if your name is missing, we are very sorry; let us know and we will update it).
As always, we very much appreciate everyone that helped out in making this
release of the GIMP Help manual possible.

- change from db2latex to dblatex stylesheets for PDF generation
- a new way has been added to manage the authors centrally in one file:
  authors.xml (like in the GIMP module). This is currently not the
  default. It needs some additional work and is currently in migration.
