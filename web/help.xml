    <title>Translating</title>
    <para>
      If you are interested in translating the manual the best way to start is
      going to <ulink url="https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gimp-help/"
      title="Damned Lies">Damned Lies</ulink>, register an account and apply to
      be a member of the language team for the language you want to translate.
      You can then start translating the po files of GIMP's manual found
      on that website.
    </para>
    <para>
      The current progress of each translation can be found on our
      <ulink url='index.html#gimp210-online'>main page</ulink>.
      Detailed information about the progress for each separate file is
      available on the already mentioned
      <ulink url="https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gimp-help/">gimp-help</ulink>
      page of Damned Lies.
    </para>
    <para>
      If your language isn't listed yet as being translated, then please
      contact us on
      <ulink url='https://www.gimp.org/discuss/'>IRC or the relevant
      mailing lists</ulink>. We will then add your language and shortly after
      the relevant files to translate will turn up on Damned Lies.

    <title>Improving the User Manual</title>
    <para>
      If you would like to help out writing and improving our documentation,
      then our <ulink url='https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp-help'>gimp-help</ulink>
      repository is the right place to start.
    </para>
    <para>
      Preferrably you build the most up to date manual yourself, or check
      the latest <ulink url='https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/'>online version</ulink>.
      The source of the manual can be found in XML files in the
      <ulink url='https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp-help/-/tree/master/src'>/src</ulink>
      directory. Find a topic that interests you or that needs updating and
      start writing.
    </para>
    <para>
      You could also take a look at our
      <ulink url='https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp-help/issues'>issue tracker</ulink>
      to see which documentation issues you can help with.
    </para>
    <para>
      Our User Manual is written in Docbook XML files. Some knowledge of
      Docbook and XML in general is useful, but if you look at the structure
      of the documents that are already written, it should not be too
      difficult. If you are uncertain about something, you can always ask, see
      the links below on how to contact us.
    </para>
    <para>
      It would be a good idea to subscribe to some of GIMP's
      <ulink url='https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html#mailing-lists'>mailing lists</ulink>,
      especially the developer and docs lists. That way you can keep up to date
      about the development of GIMP.
      Most of the GIMP developers can also be reached on the
      <ulink url='https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html#irc-matrix'>#gimp IRC channel</ulink>
      on irc.gimp.org. The best chances to talk are usually during European
      evening hours, but be patient, getting an answer can take a while. Note
      that there is no need to ask if you can ask a question: just ask.
    </para>
    <para>
      Before you can send us your changes you should have a Gnome Gitlab
      account and fork the gimp-help repository. For each new issue you work
      on, please make a separate branch. When ready push your changes to
      your branch and then open a MR (merge request).
