Quickreference
==============

If you want to translate the quickreference, create the po template
and translate the strings. For example:

    make po-de

creates po/de.po.

To create an SVG or DocBook/XML compliant file for every translation,
use make:

    make svg        # creates SVG
    make docbook    # creates a DocBook/XML

The files can be found in either 'svg' or 'docbook' directories
(whatever you created).


Update PO files if the POT has changed
======================================

You can update the <LANG-CODE>.po files with make:

   make po-<LANG-CODE>


Bugs
-----
There is currently no sane way to integrate the Docbook version in the
manual. Either the seperated files will be integrated via xincludes or
the stylesheet needs to be adjusted to put each translation in one file.
