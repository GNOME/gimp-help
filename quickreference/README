Quickreference
==============

If you want to translate the quickreference, copy the po template, use
the language code for the new file and translate the strings. For
example:

    cp gimp-keys.pot de.po

To create an SVG or DocBook/XML compliant file for every translation,
use make:

    make svg        # creates SVG
    make docbook    # creates a DocBook/XML

The files can be found in either 'svg' or 'docbook' directories
(whatever you created).

Bugs
-----
There is currently no sane way to integrate the Docbook version in the
manual. Either the seperated files will be integrated via xincludes or
the stylesheet needs to be adjusted to put each translation in one file.
