Quickreference
==============

If you want to translate the quickreference, create the po template
and translate the strings. For example:

    make po-de

creates po/de.po.

To create an SVG or DocBook/XML compliant file for every translation,
use make:

    make svg        # creates SVG
    make docbook    # creates a DocBook/XML

The files can be found in either 'svg' or 'docbook' directories
(whatever you created).

The pot file 'po/gimp-keys.pot' is needed in the repository
for l10n.gnome.org to extract translations from the quickreference.
Remember to also update and commit that file if you make changes to
'gimp-keys.xml'.

You will be required to delete the pot file before running 'make pot'
to create an updated pot file.

Update PO files if the POT has changed
======================================

You can update the <LANG-CODE>.po files with make:

   make po-<LANG-CODE>


Bugs
-----
There is currently no sane way to integrate the Docbook version in the
manual. Either the separated files will be integrated via xincludes, or
the stylesheet needs to be adjusted to put each translation in one file.
