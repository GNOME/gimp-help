Help Installation for User
==========================

First of: It is recommended, that you obtain the help files from your
distributor (Debian, Ubuntu, Windows, etc).

On your own: Installing the HTML files
--------------------------------------

This package includes pre built help files for The GIMP 2.6. The help
files can be found in the 'html' subdirectory in the following
structure:

    /html/en
    /html/de
    /html/fr

Depending for which language you downloaded the installation package,
you need to copy the html folder to the shared GIMP directory:

    $ cp html/en $prefix/share/gimp/2.0/help/
    $ ls $prefix/share/gimp/2.0/help
    en
    $ ls $prefix/share/gimp/2.0/help/en
    index.html
    <lots of html files>
    images

If the help directory in $prefix/share/gimp/2.0/ doesn't exist, create
it.
