At the moment there is no install target but this is going to change soon.
For now this document gives you some hints on how to build the help files.


The GIMP help documents are written in Docbook XML. Since the GIMP
help browser wants HTML files, the documents need to be converted.
This is done as an XSLT [1] using xsltproc [2].

To build the GIMP help files, execute the following commands:

 ./configure
 make

If you encounter any problems, these are likely caused by the XSLT
processor not being able to locate stylesheets it needs to do the
transformation. You should have an XML catalog file that helps the
XSLT processor to locate your locally installed stylesheets. In case
you are missing such a catalog file or it is incomplete, you can
specify the location of the stylesheets explicitely, for example:

 ./configure --with-xsl=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh

By default we do not allow the XSLT processor to attempt to download
external resources. If you have a fast internet connection, it may be
useful to allow xsltproc to fetch DTDs or entities over the network:

 ./configure --enable-network


If you want to test the built help files, you can create a symlink
from $prefix/share/gimp/1.3/help to the html directory.  Very soon
an install target will be added so that you can 'make install'.
