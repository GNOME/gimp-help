"The RGB Noise filter adds a normally distributed noise to a layer or a "
"selection. It uses the RGB color model to produce the noise (noise is added "
"to red, green and blue values of each pixel). A normal distribution means, "
"that only slight noise is added to the most pixels in the affected area, "
"while less pixels are affected by more extreme values. (If you apply this "
"filter to an image filled with a solid grey color and then look at its "
"histogram, you will see a classic bell-shaped Gaussian curve.)"

"Noise may be additive (uncorrelated) or multiplicative (correlated - also "

"an normally distributed value. So the noise depends on the channel values: a "
"greater channel value leads to more noise, while dark colors (small values) "
"tend to remain dark."
