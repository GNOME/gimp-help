"Often when you operate on an image, you only want part of it to be affected. "

"There are many, many situations where creating just the right selection is "
"the key to getting the result you want, and often it is not very easy to do. "
"For example, in the above image, suppose I want to cut the tree out from its "
"background, and paste it into a different image. In order to do this, I need "
"to create a selection that contains the tree and nothing but the tree. It is "
"difficult because the tree has a very complex shape, and in several spots is "
"hard to distinguish from the objects behind it."

"Now here is a very important point, and it is crucial to understand this. "
"Ordinarily when you create a selection, you see it as a dashed line enclosing "
"a portion of the image. The idea you could get from this is that the "
"selection is a sort of container, with the selected parts of the image "
"inside, and the unselected parts outside. This concept of the selection is "
"okay for many purposes, but it is not really correct."

"Actually the selection is implemented as a <emphasis>channel</emphasis>. In "
"terms of its internal structure, it is identical to the red, green, blue, and "
"alpha channels of an image. Thus, the selection has a value defined at each "
"pixel of the image, ranging between 0 (unselected) and 255 (fully selected). "
"The advantage of this approach is that it allows some pixels to be "
"<emphasis>partially selected</emphasis>, by giving them intermediate values "
"between 0 and 255. As you will see, there are many situations where it is "
"desirable to have smooth transitions between selected and unselected regions."

"You should always bear in mind, when looking at the dashed line that "

"QuickMask button in the lower left corner of the image window. This causes "
"the selection to be shown as a translucent overlay atop the image. Selected "
"areas are unaffected; unselected areas are reddened. The more completely "
"selected an area is, the less red it appears."

"With the default settings, the basic selection tools, such as the Rectangle "
"Select tool, create sharp selections. Pixels inside the dashed line are fully "

"toggling QuickMask: you see a clear rectangle with sharp edges, surrounded by "
"uniform red. In the Tool Options, however, is a checkbox called "
"<quote>Feather edges</quote>. If you enable this, the tool will instead "
"create graduated selections. The feather radius, which you can adjust, "

"Actually, it is possible to feather a selection at any time, even if it was "

"guimenuitem></menuchoice>. This brings up a dialog that allows you to set the "
"feather radius. You can do the opposite--sharpen a graduated selection into "
