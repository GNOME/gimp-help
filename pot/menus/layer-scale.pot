"When you enlarge a layer, <acronym>GIMP</acronym> has to calculate new pixels "

"new information is added to the image by interpolation. If there are places "
"in the layer which have no details, you will not get any new ones by scaling "
"it. It is much more likely that the layer will look somewhat blurred after "
"scaling. Similarly, when you reduce a layer, the image loses some of its "

"If you enlarge a layer, the missing pixels are calculated by interpolation, "

"you can improve the result by using the <link linkend=\"plug-in-sharpen"

"resolution when scanning, taking digital photographs or producing digital "
"images by other means. It is an inherent characteristic of raster images that "
