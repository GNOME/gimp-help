"<guilabel>Preserve Luminosity</guilabel> option off, the resulting picture "
"would be at 75%+75%+0% =150%, very bright indeed. A pixel with a value of, "
"say, R,G,B=127,100,80 would map to 127*0.75+100*0.75+80*0=170 for each "
"channel. With the Preserve Luminosity option on, the sliders will be scaled "
"so they always add up to 100%. In this example, that scale value is 1/(75%+75%"
"+0%) or 0.667. So the pixel values would be about 113. The Preserve "
"Luminosity option just assures that the scale values from the sliders always "
"adds up to 100%. Of course, strange things happen when any of the sliders "
"have large negative values </quote> (from the plug-in author himself)."
