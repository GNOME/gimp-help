"The <guimenuitem>White Balance</guimenuitem> command automatically adjusts "
"the colors of the active layer by stretching the Red, Green and Blue channels "
"separately. To do this, it discards pixel colors at each end of the Red, "
"Green and Blue histograms which are used by only 0.05% of the pixels in the "
"image and stretches the remaining range as much as possible. The result is "
"that pixel colors which occur very infrequently at the outer edges of the "
"histograms (perhaps bits of dust, etc.) do not negatively influence the "
"minimum and maximum values used for stretching the histograms, in comparison "
"with <link linkend=\"plug-in-c-astretch\">Stretch Contrast</link>. Like "
"<quote>Stretch Contrast</quote>, however, there may be hue shifts in the "
"resulting image."
