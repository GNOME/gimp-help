"The <guimenuitem>Color Enhance</guimenuitem> command increases the saturation "
"range of the colors in the layer, without altering brightness or hue. It does "
"this by converting the colors to HSV space, measuring the range of saturation "
"values across the image, then stretching this range to be as large as "
"possible, and finally converting the colors back to RGB. It is similar to "
"<link linkend=\"plug-in-c-astretch\">Stretch Contrast</link>, except that it "
"works in the HSV color space, so it preserves the hue. It works on layers "
"from RGB and Indexed images. If the image is Grayscale, the menu entry is "
"insensitive and grayed out."
