"<emphasis>How to fix:</emphasis> If doing this has destroyed a selection that "
"you wanted to keep, hit Ctrl-Z (undo) a couple of times to restore it, and "
"then we'll figure out what the problem is. There are a couple of "
"possibilities. If you couldn't see any selection, there may have been a very "
"tiny one, or even one that contained no pixels. If this was the case, it "
"surely is not a selection that you wanted to keep, so why have you gotten "
"this far in the first place? If you can see a selection but thought you were "
"inside it, it might be inverted from what you think. The easiest way to tell "
"is to hit the Quick Mask button: the selected area will be clear and the "
"unselected area will be masked. If this was the problem, then you can solve "
"it by toggling Quick Mask off and choosing Invert in the <guimenu>Select</"
