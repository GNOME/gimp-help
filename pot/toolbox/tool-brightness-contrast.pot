"The Brightness-Contrast tool adjusts the brightness and contrast levels for "
"the active layer or selection. This tool is easy to use, but relatively "
"unsophisticated. The Levels and Curve tools allow you to make the same types "
"of adjustments, but also give you the ability to treat bright colors "
"differently from darker colors. Generally speaking, the BC tool is great for "
"doing a \"quick and dirty\" adjustment in a few seconds, but if the image is "
"important and you want it to look as good as possible, you will use one of "
"the other tools."
