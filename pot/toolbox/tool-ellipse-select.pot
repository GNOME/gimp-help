"This tool is also used for rendering a circle or ellipse on an image. To "

"create an elliptical outline, the simplest and most flexible approach is to "
"create an elliptical selection and then <link linkend=\"gimp-selection-stroke"
"\">stroke</link> it. However, the quality of anti-aliasing with this approach "
"is rather crude. A higher quality outline can be obtained by creating two "
"elliptical selections with different sizes, subtracting the inner one from "
"the outer one; however this is not always easy to get right. The command "
"<menuchoice><guimenu>Selection</guimenu><guimenuitem>Border...</guimenuitem></"
